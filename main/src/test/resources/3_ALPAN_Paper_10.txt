Introduction
1. This paper examines the effects of drought-induced livestock losses on crop production and
considers a range of policy measures aimed at rehabilitation of the farm sector in the postdrought period. Farm animals play an important role in crop production in a number of farming
systems. Draft animals are used for ploughing and weeding fields and for transporting goods
and people. Female stock provide the household with supplies of milk while animal dung is a
source of fertiliser and fuel. Livestock also represent a valuable asset for the farm household,
the loss of which makes it poorer and more vulnerable to adversity.
2. The paper focusses on policies which can be carried out in the short-to medium-term to
reduce the length of time taken for the farm sector to recover its productive capacity after
drought. It assumes that losses of a certain magnitude have already taken place and thus
does not consider the role of pre-drought or emergency measures, such as early warning
systems or provision of famine relief. Rehabilitation is taken here to mean the reestablishment of productive farm capacity in drought-affected regions. This may not always
imply the restoration of the production system as it was before the drought. For example, very
heavy grazing pressure from oxen and other stock may mean that alternative sources of draft
power should be found or fodder crop production be increased.
3. Since the main focus of this paper is on live-stock-related aspects of farm production, it will
not consider explicitly the need to provide seed and other inputs in order to help farm
recovery. However, it is recognised that seed distribution may be a precondition for successful
post-drought recovery where crop losses have been high. There are also important
interactions between the farm and livestock sectors which need to be examined. Drought
losses in the pastoral sector affect farmers through changes in the supply and prices of stock.
In addition, policy measures taken to aid recovery in the pastoral sector may have spillover
effects on the farm sector and vice versa. An example of this is where farmers are given credit
to buy young oxen to replace those they have lost, a programme which is likely to have an
inflationary effect on the price of such animals leading to a rise in prices received by pastoral
herd-owners.
4. The paper starts by outlining the main effects of drought on crop producers in order to show
the various processes through which impoverishment of farmers and losses of stock take
place. It goes on to consider the interaction between droughts in the arable and livestock
sectors before looking at indigenous strategies for rehabilitation pursued by producers
themselves, following drought losses. It then examines the various policy options open to
governments and development agencies wishing to speed recovery in the crop sector and
discusses the relative costs and problems associated with each. It will be seen that the most
effective form of intervention will depend on the special circumstances found in the region
concerned. The paper ends by recommending that priority be given to examining the different
options available in a given case and to funding a programme that can be put rapidly into
effect.

Effects of drought on farm production and livestock holdings
5. The main direct effects of drought on the farming sector are summarised in Figure 1. The
most immediate consequence of drought is a fall in crop production, due to inadequate and
poorly distributed rainfall. Farmers are faced with harvests that are too small to both feed their
families and fulfill their other commitments. Livestock sales act as a buffer in times of
hardship, farmers disinvesting in these assets to buy food. The first animals to be sold are
usually those which make the least contribution to farm production, such as sheep and goats.
However, as the period of drought-induced food deficit lengthens, farmers will have to start
selling transport and draft animals, such as oxen and donkeys, as well as breeding stock,
which constitute the basis of the household's wealth. In the Ethiopian highlands, stock are
usually disposed of in the following order: sheep and goats, then younger cattle, with horses,
donkeys and work oxen being sold as a last resort (Wood, 1976), since the latter are essential
for land preparation.
6. Where crops have been badly affected by drought, pasture production is also likely to be
reduced although output from natural pastures tends to be less vulnerable to drought than
crop production. Low rainfall causes poor pasture growth and may also lead to a decline in
fodder supplies from crop residues. Insufficient levels of fodder around the village lead to
weight less and increased deaths among stock, especially where immigrant herds put further
pressure on limited local pastures. While the response of most pastoral groups to fodder
shortage is to move themselves and their herds elsewhere, this is not an option so easily
followed by livestock-owning farmers. Typically, farmers own fewer animals and have less
familiarity with regular transhumance than pastoralists, both of which act as constraints on
migration. In addition, few farm households will have sufficient labour to both take their
animals to other grazing areas and continue with necessary farming operations. Thus,
sedentary herds can be particularly badly hit in times of drought. A recent survey of deaths
among draft animals in the Niono area of north-west Mali found losses of between 50 and
70% over the period 1983-84 (FAO, 1984). These high losses were caused by pasture
shortages exacerbated by herds from further north on their way to southern pastures, by the
sedentary character of livestock holdings amongst farmers in this area and by the normal
dependence of horses (and to some extent donkeys) on a daily grain ration to supplement
natural grazing, a supplement which is no longer given because of poor harvests.
7. The overall effect of a fall in fodder and crop production is to reduce the draft capacity of
the farming sector, leading to lower crop output in the subsequent farming season. Loss of
livestock around the farming settlement also reduces the household's access to dung, a
product of considerable importance both as a fuel where firewood is scarce and as a means
to retain fertility on regularly cropped soils.
8. The role and importance of dung varies between farming systems according to a number of
factors. Shortage of fuelwood makes dung a highly valued commodity in many parts of the
Ethiopian highlands where other sources of fuel are scarce. Dung is estimated to be the
second most important product gained from livestock after draft power in such areas, providing
up to 80% of the household's fuel needs in many areas (Gryseels and Anderson, 1983). In
addition, sales of dung cakes make a contribution to cash incomes. In many parts of West
Africa, dung is a major element in the exchanges established between pastoral and farming
communities. Transhumant herders agree to station their animals overnight on farmers' plots
in return for grain, cash or water. This manuring of fields produces a considerable increase in

crop yields and is of especial value in marginal farming zones in the Sahel as it enables a
larger area to be sown with rapid maturing crop varieties. Drought affects the availability of
dung to the farm household in two ways. First, the number of animals owned by the farming
population falls with death and sales among stock. Second, drought both reduces the size and
changes the pattern of movement among pastoral herds. In the Sahelian context, drought
conditions will force many herd-owners further South than normal in their search for fodder
and water. Farmers in the southern Sahel, who regularly rely on visiting herds for supplies of
dung will find their access to this commodity greatly reduced in a drought year. By contrast,
yet further south, dung supplies will increase for those farming communities in savannah
areas which are host to immigrant pastoral herds in a drought year.
9. Although they could not be considered as a loss to the national economy, to the individual
farmer drought-induced distress sales of work oxen are as much of a loss as are animal
deaths. In addition, since distress sales are associated with reduced prices offered, farmers
also incur a substantial financial loss compared to sales under more normal circumstances.
The distribution of work oxen losses between deaths and distress sales will vary according to
the circumstances in which drought has taken place and the constraints faced by different
producers. A report by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission of Ethiopia for the province of
Wollo in 1974 presents data showing almost all losses to have been due to deaths rather than
sales: 71% dead from starvation, as opposed to 19% sold, leaving 2% disposed of by other
means and 8% remaining (Wolde Mariam, 1984). By contrast, Wood's survey of farmers in the
northern highlands of Ethiopia in 1974 found that most livestock losses were the result of
distress sales in order to raise cash rather than deaths due to inadequate fodder (Wood,
1976). As will be discussed later, the circumstances in which oxen are lost have differing
implications for the action that governments or agencies should take in moderating the effects
of drought.
10. One means by which farm households try to make ends meet in times of crop failure is to
release labour to earn income elsewhere; at the same time, this reduces the burden on
household food reserves. The net effect on farm productivity depends on whether this
migration continues into the next farming season, thereby reducing the household's labour
supply. This will be the case where shortage of food is so acute that the household must
depend on the earnings of some of its members to feed the rest of the family until the next
harvest.
11. Changes in the distribution of wealth usually accompany drought. The experience of farm
households will differ according to their ownership of assets, their access to incomes from
other sources and the extent to which these assets and incomes are less affected by drought
than are harvests. The most vulnerable amongst those hit by drought will be those with few
assets to sell, those who most need to purchase grain due to an absence of their own
household reserves and those who cannot gain access to food through other means, such as
borrowing, coercion or theft. The richest members of the community may even be in a position
to benefit during drought, as they can acquire land and other assets at low prices from
distress sales by poorer neighbours. The differential impact of drought on the incomes and
assets of rich and poor is formalised by Sen in his essay on "Poverty and Famines" (1981).
He showed an individual's entitlement to food depends not only on direct output of crops, etc.
but also on his access to food through the market, by the sale of labour or other commodities
and through non-market mechanisms, such as redistributive systems within society. In times
of drought, not only is there a direct shortfall of food production but also relative price
movements of grain versus other commodities may drastically reduce the purchasing power of
groups. This is seen in the case of pastoralists who face rising grain prices but failing livestock
prices as drought intensifies. Pastoralists face a major decision problem related to the timing
of sales which minimize unfavourable grain/livestock ratios. Many farmers may be in a similar
situation, needing to sell livestock, labour or land in markets where an excess supply of these

commodities has reduced their value.

The interaction between livestock and arable droughts
12. Where crop farming and livestock production take place in the same ecological zone, the
former is likely to be the activity to be more severely affected by drought in the shorter term herds can be moved to areas where pasture production has not been affected to the same
extent. Thus droughts occurring in areas occupied by crops and animals in Botswana have
affected crop production more frequently (Jones, 1979). In the case of the Sahel, however, the
crop farming areas occupy the higher rainfall zones to the south of the main pastoral areas
which are subject to low levels and erratic distributions of rainfall within and between years.
Since rainfall variability becomes more marked as one moves north and as rainfall totals
decline, the pastoral sector has particularly been more prone to drought. Thus in the drought
years of 1968 to 1973, it was pastoral zones of the northern Sahel which were especially badly
hit, while many southern farming areas experienced very few drought-induced losses.
13. Account must be taken of the interaction between drought losses in the crop and livestock
sectors for two reasons.
(i) Grain forms an important part of the pastoral diet even in normal times. In
periods of drought, as herd productivity falls, herders come to rely even more
heavily on grain for their food needs. Where both the livestock and farm sectors
have been hit by drought, rising demand for grain by pastoralists is confronted by
a drop in locally available supplies. Given the low elasticity of demand for grains,
the increase in market demand from farmers and herders will result in a rapid
escalation in prices. If drought has only hit the livestock sector, grain prices will be
subject to much less upward pressure.
(ii) Farmers often own a number of livestock, which provide them with draft power
and represent capital to be liquidated in times of need. Where drought has hit both
the livestock and farming sectors, livestock prices will fall further and farmers will
be faced with a greater fall in the value of their livestock assets. A few farmers
may however benefit during a period of widespread drought if they are fortunate
enough to have sufficient stocks of grain from previous harvests to invest in
livestock purchases while relative grain to livestock prices are in their favour.

Farmers' own methods of rehabilitation
Speed of farm rehabilitation
Ways in which farmers can achieve crop recovery
14. Policy makers should assess the capacity of crop and livestock production systems to
rehabilitate themselves in the absence of outside intervention for two reasons.
15. First, one must have some measure of expected rates of rehabilitation against which to
evaluate the impact and cost of various forms of intervention aimed at boosting recovery.
Second, indigenous strategies in the post-drought period provide policy-makers with
guidelines as to processes of local adaptation which may be given support. Communities often
display considerable resilience in the face of drought, enabling them to survive severe crises
and to regain their capacity to produce in the subsequent period. The policies of government
and development agencies can either re-inforce the effectiveness of these strategies or render
them less viable. For example, temporary migration of labour from rural areas is pursued on a
regular basis in many countries and provides households with an off-farm cash income. In
times of drought, this migration flow becomes especially important, as it both reduces the
number of people to be fed from village granaries and provides a supplementary income for
buying food. Government policy can either aid or hamper this flow of labour from poor to
better-off regions, by minimising the bureaucratic obstacles to and cost of movement or,
conversely, it can make it difficult for people to travel across regional and national frontiers
and obtain temporary employment.

Speed of farm rehabilitation
16. The main concern of this paper has been to investigate the effects of drought-induced
livestock losses on the farm sector. The significance of a given level of draft animal losses on
farm production will depend on the nature of the farming system and the effectiveness of
different strategies pursued by farmers in order to maintain crop output. To assess the likely
fall in crop output due to draft animal losses, questions such as the following must be
answered:
(i) what proportion of land is normally prepared and weeded by the plough?
(ii) how much time is available for land preparation before sowing?
(iii) what is the effect on yields from late sowing, from sowing on unploughed land
or from weeding by hand rather than by plough?
(iv) can land be prepared by hand and, if so, what is the area that can be dealt
with?
(v) what proportion of households have the necessary animals and equipment for
their own plough team and what are the possibilities for sharing of oxen between
households?
17. This paper focusses attention on three countries: Ethiopia, Botswana and Mali, where draft

animal power plays an important role in farm production. The significance of work oxen losses
will vary between these countries because of differences in soils and in the volume and timing
of rainfall within the cultivation season. For example, the heavy soils found in highland
Ethiopia must be worked 4 to 6 times in order to obtain a fine enough seedbed for the
traditional teff crop. This is in marked contrast to the very rapid ridging of light sandy soils
done by many farmers in Mali prior to sowing millet and groundnuts. For highland areas of
Ethiopia, the short rains of February to April usually provide the opportunity for much land
preparation to take place before fields are sown in June when the main rains begin. In arable
areas of Botswana and the Sahel, time available for land preparation before sowing is much
more limited and part of the Sahelian millet crop is consequently sown on unploughed land,
despite the severe weeding problems associated with this technique.

Ways in which farmers can achieve crop recovery
18. There are a number of options that farmers can pursue in order to restore levels of crop
production and their holdings of draft animals. These include the sharing of animals between
households, use of other stock for pulling the plough, hand cultivation of soils, hire of tractor
services, changes in crop composition, purchase of fertiliser, supplementation of remaining
stock, turning to income earned elsewhere or waiting for livestock holdings to re-grow. Each of
these is discussed below.
19. Sharing of animals between households may be possible where overall losses have been
slight. Such animal loans are common in many farming systems in normal years, the loan of a
ploughteam often being repaid with so many days of weeding labour. Alternatively, two
households with a single ox each can arrange to take turns in using the oxen pair, as
described by Gryseels and Anderson (1983) for Ethiopia. However, where oxen losses have
been heavy, loans will be less easy to arrange for those who have lost their draft animals and
the cost of such loans are likely to increase.
20. The use of other animals for draft may be possible where, for example, losses among
horses and donkeys have been less severe than work oxen. The former will have a lower
productivity but their availability will partially compensate for the loss of trained oxen. In
extreme cases, even human labour has been used for pulling the plough, as in the period
following the great rinderpest epidemic in Ethiopia in the 1890s when an estimated 90% of the
country's draft oxen were lost (Wolde Mariam, 1984). However, if work oxen holdings have
been badly affected by drought it is likely that other stock will also have suffered high mortality
or will have been sold to purchase food grains.
21. Hand cultivation of part of the farmer's land may be possible in the absence of draft
animals. However, this will be at the cost of lower crop output due both to the smaller area
cultivated and the lower effectiveness of hand cultivation as opposed to plough techniques.
Estimates of the land area which can be cultivated by hand vary from 10% to 50% of that
which can be managed by a plough team, depending on the nature of soils and the time
available for land preparation. Although uncommon where weeding is also done by plough,
resort to hand techniques will lead to lower yields from the less optimal timing of this
operation.
22. The hire of tractor services is only open to a limited number of farmers with access to this
service at reasonable cost. Hire of a tractor is usually more expensive than hire of a plough
team for the same work and, in the case of Botswana, will normally require a cash outlay
rather than repayment in labour or other services (Vierich and Sheppard, 1979). For this
reason, farmers who find themselves without work oxen will often also be without the funds to
hire a tractor.
23. A change in the composition of crops grown can reduce the farmer's tillage requirements.

For example, in the case of Ethiopia, while teff needs a finely prepared seed bed, pulses can
be sown on land that has received a more rudimentary tillage. Similarly, in Mali, millets can be
sown on unploughed land whereas groundnuts require a prepared seedbed. The possibility of
farmers moderating the impact of draft animal losses by switching to less tillage-intensive
crops depends on their access to seed, their family's consumption needs and the prospects
for marketing different crops.
24. Fertiliser purchases can moderate the fall in crop output arising from a decline in area
cultivated by raising yields on the area actually farmed. The effectiveness of this option
depends on crop response to fertiliser use and the relative costs of purchase, transport and
application of fertiliser. Lack of cash at the farm level in the post-drought period prevents this
option being widely pursued, in the absence of extensive government subsidies for the
purchase and distribution of this input. Even then, farmers may still consider the use of
fertiliser in poor seasons as involving too high a risk.
25. Surviving draft animal may be given supplementary feed in order to increase their working
capacity. This fodder could come from crop by-products or natural pasture and browse, both
of which are likely to be in short supply following drought. Additional feed may be available
from agro-industrial by-products, such as cotton seed, molasses and bran. Supplies of these
products will be limited and their prices high where these are normally exported, (as in the
case of many Sahelian countries) unless the government gives special priority to their local
use.
26. Incomes earned elsewhere can be used to buy replacement oxen. For example, migration
earnings are a major source of cash incomes for many farming areas in southern Africa and
the Sahel. Migration may be seasonal or involve the absence of a male household member for
a number of years, during which time cash remittances are sent back to the farm sector for the
purchase both of food and farm inputs. The ease with which these earnings can be used to
finance the purchase of new work animals depends on the relative value of the remittance, the
price of work oxen and the urgency of other calls upon cash income. In times of drought,
urban labour markets are usually flooded with job-seekers leading to low real wage levels. For
this reason, the size of migration earnings is likely to be low in the post-drought period and
possibilities for acquiring the funds to purchase work oxen more limited than in normal times. It
will also be harder for farmers to rebuild work oxen holdings where both the arable and the
farm sector have been hit by drought. In this case there will be heavy demand in the postdrought period from both the farming sector and the meat market for the limited supply of
young male animals and prices will rise accordingly.
27. Waiting for the herd to re-grow is an option for those farm households with sufficient
breeding animals. The speed of recovery in work oxen numbers will depend in this case on the
number of oxen required for ploughing, the size of the breeding herd and its rate of increase.
However, some arrangement must be made in the intervening years either to obtain food or to
borrow draft power from elsewhere.
28. The speed with which harvests recover and holdings of draft animals are reconstituted
depends on the factors discussed above. This process of reconstitution will be more rapid
where:
- sharing of animals provides a temporary means by which those without draft
animals can continue to cultivate all of their land,
- the agricultural sector is sufficiently productive for farmers to have access to a
regular surplus for investment and where the relative price of crops to oxen is in
favour of the former, so that a good harvest can enable the farmer to replace lost
animals in a single year,

- there are external sources of income which can be used to buy new animals and
equipment and to provide for the household's food needs in the intervening period.
29. Conversely, rehabilitation will be slower the heavier are oxen losses, the greater the area
affected by crop and livestock losses and the higher the price of oxen relative to crop output
and migrants' earnings.

The speed of post-drought recovery
30. Post-drought surveys provide some data on the evolution of harvests over subsequent
years and on the time taken for crop production to get back to normal levels. However, there
are often a number of other factors affecting total harvest size in the post-drought period which
make it hard to assess the relative importance of work-oxen losses as compared with
variables such as lack of seed, rainfall levels, social and political dislocation, etc..
31. The drought year of 1978/79 in Botswana saw an estimated 60% fall in area cultivated in
the region surveyed, caused by the poor condition of work oxen and the poor timing of rainfall
at the start of the farming season. However, the following season appears to have seen an
increase in area cultivated above normal levels, farmers having an incentive to increase their
field size, given shortages in food supplies (Jones, 1980). This increase in area following the
drought was made possible by the relatively low losses (of 10-15%) suffered among draft
animal holdings and the extensive systems for loaning draft power between households. The
latter implies that there was slack capacity in the system in Botswana.
32. In the case of the Sahel, no material is available on the speed with which area cultivated
returned to normal after the drought of 1968-73. However, grain production figures would
suggest that harvests were back to pre-drought levels in 1974, which would imply no
significant adverse impact on farm productive capacity as a result of the drought. This may be
explained by the relatively low losses of harvests and oxen in most farming areas, so that area
farmed and output could return rapidly to normal once rainfall conditions improved. By
contrast, recent material from north-west Mali would suggest a fall in area cultivated of
between 30 and 50% in 1984, due to heavy losses of draft animals the previous year. Even
with the return to better rainfall in 1985, such farming areas cannot hope to obtain a
reasonable harvest.
33. For Ethiopia, data on crop output and area cultivated is scarce for the periods surrounding
the droughts of the early 70s and those of 1982-84. Wolde Mariam (1984) cites a report for
Wollo and Tigre in which previous losses of work oxen are held to account for between 44 and
87% of the cases in which land was not cultivated in 1973, with seed shortages mentioned as
being of only secondary importance. Crop production figures suggest that 1974 saw a return
to more normal levels of output at the national level but these figures should be treated with
care as they refer to national output rather than to that from the most drought-affected
provinces. In subsequent years, additional factors, such as land reform, and political instability
have themselves contributed further to difficulties in assessing changes in farm output for the
drought-prone areas of Wollo and Tigre. Data for crop production in 1985 is patchy and it is
difficult to separate the effects of work oxen losses from the other major influences on the level
of farming activity in different regions of the country.

Policy measures to aid recovery of the farm sector
Government policy measures
Direct help to the farm sector
34. This section will consider the alternative policy options open to governments and development
agencies aimed at speeding the recovery of farm production after drought. As in the rest of this
paper, it focusses on livestock-related aspects of crop production. Thus, it does not consider explicitly
the need for seed provision, although access to seed is evidently a precondition for restoring
production levels.
35. Policy options can be divided into three categories: those that enable the farm sector to help
itself, such as lowering rates of taxation; those that aid the farm sector by the direct provision of
inputs, such as credit to buy oxen and fertiliser; and those which, though directed at the livestock
sector, nevertheless have a beneficial effect on farmers' ability to reconstitute their draft animal
holdings. Within each category, there are certain actions which are properly the domain of the
national government, such as pricing and taxation policy, while others are open to both governments
and agencies to undertake, such as the funding of a credit programme.
36. Policies differ with respect to their cost, their impact on different producer and consumer groups,
their effect on the external trade balance, their spillover effects into other sectors of the economy and
the speed with which they can be implemented. These different impacts should be taken into account
by decision-makers before deciding which options to pursue. In addition, governments will find that
the probability of receiving external funding differs between policy measures, donors being more
willing to fund direct interventions in farm production than to provide general financial support for the
government budget.
37. Several policy options considered below involve government intervention in controlling prices,
trade flows or providing subsidised inputs to the farm sector. These policies presuppose a structure
through which governments are able to act effectively at little extra cost. In practice, the absence of
the necessary degree of government control limits the likely effectiveness of certain measures. For
example, where the government has little control of livestock exports, due to long frontiers which are
costly to police, measures to ban exports of certain classes of stock are unlikely to be very effective.
Finally, all policy options need to be compared with the cost of not taking any action and the
consequent need for famine relief provision.

Government policy measures
38. Several policy instruments are considered here: changes in taxation of the farm and livestock
sectors, increases in crop and livestock prices, minimization of constraints on labour migration from
rural areas and controls on animal exports. The main aim of these measures is to reduce the
pressure on farm incomes and thereby allow a more rapid return to pre-drought levels of production.
(a) A reduction in poll or land tax helps recovery as it leaves the farmer with more
disposable income for investment in new animals and farm equipment. Changes in the
level of taxation on cattle will have a less clear-cut effect. To the extent that the farmer
owns livestock, a tax reduction per animal head will be of benefit. However, such a
reduction will also reduce the pressure on herders' incomes and their need to sell stock,
leading to lower supply of and higher prices for livestock. This will be to the disadvantage
of farmers wishing to purchase animals to restore their work oxen holdings. Tax cuts
have the advantage of being speedy to implement. However, they do cut government
income and, in the case of a simple tax cut for all producers, do not differentiate between

the better-off and those truly in need. A tax system able to direct benefits to a more
specific target group would be more complex and costly to implement.
(b) Where the government controls the price and marketing of major crops, resources
can be channelled to the farm sector by raising farm prices for crops. However, the scope
for this policy measure is probably fairly limited, first because farmers who have lost their
draft animals are unlikely to have a significant crop surplus for sale and second, because
the government will be very reluctant to increase the cost of food to urban consumers.
Government attempts to manipulate livestock prices, in order to help farmers purchase
new work oxen (i.e. at lower prices), may also be of limited value given the large
proportion of domestic and external trade which passes through unofficial channels in
many countries. Even where this is not the case, controlled prices are likely to confront
enforcement problems. Oxen price subsidy schemes may be an apparent alternative but
these usually entail costs over and above the face value of the financial burden on the
government. Credit programmes with various options discussed a little later, would seem
to be a better alternative.
(c) Minimising the constraints on rural migration was noted earlier as a way that
governments can help indigenous efforts at rehabilitation at little or no cost. The degree
to which migrants' earnings can contribute to rebuilding farm assets will depend on the
relative supply of and demand for labour in areas receiving immigrants, which will in turn
depend on how extensive the drought has been.
(d) Several countries have imposed controls over the export of livestock following
drought, in order to retain some animals within the national herd and to moderate upward
pressure on domestic livestock and meat Prices. The effectiveness of these controls will
vary, given differing capacities to direct animals through official channels. However, even
where it is relatively easy to evade border controls, the imposition of an export ban on
stock is likely to depress prices to a certain extent. The greater the downward effect on
prices, the more farmers will benefit from being able to buy cheap draft animals.

Direct help to the farm sector.
39. There are several ways in which governments and agencies can mitigate the impact of work oxen
losses on farm production. Some of these policies have been pursued in the past in Ethiopia and
Botswana while others are currently being undertaken. Here, the options will be compared in terms of
their relative costs and the particular problems associated with the implementation of each. Details of
each option are presented in Table 1. Data on costs are taken from a number of different sources,
referring to interventions at different dates and for differing localities. They should thus be treated
with caution as they indicate rough orders of magnitude rather than precise costings. Their utility lies
in presenting the kind of rapid calculation of returns from alternative policy options which
governments and agencies need to do in order to identify the best course of action in a given
situation.
(a) Work oxen credit to farmers involves the issue of loans to farmers, in cash or in the
form of animals, for repayment over a period of years. A number of work oxen credit
schemes have been carried out in different countries within general programmes of
agricultural development, but few have had the restoration of drought-induced oxen
losses as their explicit objective. One of the few examples of the latter was that pursued
by the Ethiopian government over the first 6 months of 1974, during which an estimated
40,000 loans were given out to farmers in drought-affected regions (EPID, 1974).
Following the 1982-84 drought in Ethiopia, a number of agencies have also been
involved in distributing oxen to farmers, either on credit or as gifts. A number of questions
are raised by work oxen credit schemes.
40. First, what are the possibilities for distributing one ox per farmer rather than a full team, with a
view either to farmers sharing their animals or to the introduction of single ox cultivation techniques?
(See Gryseels et al, 1984 and ILCA, 1986).

41. Second, what are the number of oxen available for purchase, either within the region or in
neighbouring rangeland areas and what are their relative prices in each case, including transport
costs?
42. Third, how satisfactory are the grazing resources in the region which is to receive the oxen? In
the absence of natural pastures, the cost of providing alternative supplies of fodder for example by
keeping oxen in neighbouring areas where pasture conditions are better or by transporting fodder to
animals in pasture deficit areas must be considered. The latter is likely to be considerably more
expensive than other options. The long-term availability of fodder must also be considered. Where
the pressure of human and livestock populations is already very great, decision-makers should
consider the possibility either of increasing fodder production, through increased cultivation of forage
crops, or of replacing oxen as the main source of draft power with mechanised techniques.
43. Fourth, should farmers be given a cash loan with which to purchase oxen or should oxen be
distributed directly? There are many advantages to the farmer being the purchaser of his own ox. He
makes the choice among available animals and thus is not forced to take an animal which he feels to
be unsuitable for any reason. In addition, farmers will have a good knowledge of local opportunities
for the purchase of oxen not readily available to project staff. The overall effect on oxen prices of a
large number of purchases by individual farmers spread over a period of several weeks or months, is
likely to be lower than that of a large scale operation by a project agency. On the other hand,
agencies may have access to sources of animals at lower prices from more distant areas which
cannot easily be reached by individual farmers. However, transport costs will be higher when oxen
must be brought in from far away. In addition oxen taken from a different rainfall and ecological zone
may find it difficult to adapt to grazing conditions and diseases in the farming region to which they
have been brought.
44. The granting of loans directly to farmers does increase the risk of fraud, as it will be hard to
monitor whether the ox presented by the farmer as having been bought with the loan was in fact
bought, or whether it has been borrowed from a neighbour or was already owned etc. A certain level
of fraud is probably acceptable if it keeps down administrative costs and allows a large number of
individuals to be reached quickly. Also, fraud involving the use of funds by needy recipients for
purposes other than those intended is of much less importance than fraud involving the diversion of
cash to those not truly in need.
45. Fifth, should oxen be distributed on credit or as an outright gift and, if the former, what should be
the terms of loan repayment? There may be circumstances in which the option of making a gift of the
stock should be seriously considered, as where the cost of collecting loan repayments is going to be
high and will absorb scarce administrative capacity. Where there are considerable risks to stock
there is also an argument in favour of gifts rather than loans as, in the case of future drought, farmers
will be faced with great difficulty in repaying loans. On the other hand, repayments can be used to
form a revolving fund providing further credit to farmers, thus widening the spread of benefits from the
original provision of funds.

context but relatively low for conditions in the Sahel and southern Africa.
(2) Assumes a minimum of 250 ha. ploughed per year per tractor and annual running
costs of around US$I 0,000, including depreciation.
(5) With assumed increase in output of 200-400 kgs/ha., return on fertiliser purchase is
from US$60-120 (grain valued at US$300-400 per ton, as noted earlier).
(6) Total cost of supplementation is US$20-45 per oxen pair. Assumes that following this
supplementation, oxen pair performance raised from I ha. to 3 ha.
46. In the case of loans, the project must decide on the terms of repayment. If loan repayments are
set too high, farmers may be unable to save sufficient surplus to invest in the new draft animals
essential to the long-term rehabilitation of the farm's productive capital. The various schemes
involving work oxen credit programmes which have been carried out in East and West Africa have
had repayment periods of between 3 and 5 years, an upper limit on the length of the repayment
period being set by the increasing risk of death as animals age. Repayments on the credit scheme
run by EPID in Ethiopia following the 1972-73 drought were to be made over a 4 year period.
However, very few of these loans seem to have been subsequently repaid, given continuing drought
in some areas and the political uncertainty following land reform.
(b) Government-run tractor pools are based on the government purchasing a fleet of
tractors which are then made available to farmers for a fee. Benefits from such a scheme
will be greatest where the terrain is suited for tractor cultivation, that is, not too hilly and
with few rocks and tree stumps, and where oxen and pasture shortages are so acute that
no alternative sources of draft power can be considered. The costs of such schemes are
likely to be substantial, given the high foreign exchange cost of purchasing the tractors,
and of the spare parts and fuel which will be needed for their operation. The cost of
providing skilled labour, necessary for the operation and repair of equipment, will make
yet further demands on government funds. Shortages of any of the inputs required to
keep the tractors in working order will increase the risk and the cost per hectare of
pursuing this option. At the time of the EPID programme in Ethiopia in 1974, the cost of
setting up a tractor pool was estimated at E$20,000 per tractor, in comparison with a cost
to the farmer of E$60-70 per hectare if tractors were rented from large farmers. The
establishment of a government-run tractor pool would only be cost-effective:
- if each government tractor could plough a sufficient number of hectares to
bring the per hectare cost close to that of the private sector.
- if the value of dry season work by the tractor pool, such as the transport of
goods, is sufficiently great to compensate for a lower level of ploughing
capacity in the farming season;
- and if the available draft capacity from other sources is so low, whether
from oxen or from locally-owned tractors, that the relevant comparison which
should be made is not that of the relative costs of preparing land by
alternative techniques but rather the cost of ploughing using governmentowned tractors versus the cost in foregone output of the land not being
cultivated at all.
47. While schemes for providing draft power to farmers after drought have focussed on the use of
tractors, there may also be alternative mechanical options worth considering, such as small rotary
cultivators which can be used on steep plots of land.

(c) Loans for the hire of local tractor services are an alternative in some circumstances.
For example, in Botswana, even in normal years, farmers regularly hire tractors
belonging to others in order to prepare their land. The governments of both Botswana
and Ethiopia have in the past granted loans to farmers for hiring tractor power to
compensate for drought losses among oxen. The cost of these has varied from US$20-40
a hectare, which the farmer is supposed to repay after the harvest. Evidently, the
feasibility of this scheme depends on the number of tractors available within a reasonable
distance, their spare working capacity and the suitability of farmers' plots to this
ploughing technique. There will be costs in the form of fuel, spare parts and skilled labour
requirements but these will be borne by the tractor-owners rather than the government.
The main disadvantage of this scheme is that it does not provide farmers with a renewal
of their productive capacity and they will need to find help from this or another draft
source in the years to come.
(d) Provision of hand tools is a low cost way to provide households with the means to
farm their land. The viability of this option depends on how much land can be cultivated
by hand in comparison with the plough and on the associated decline in yield per hectare.
The extent to which yields will be lower for hand- as opposed to plough team-prepared
and weeded land will be determined by the importance of timely sowing and weeding, by
the area of land cultivated per worker and the consequent tightness of land preparation
and weeding constraints. Where each worker farms a large area and where seed must
be planted early to ensure a reasonable yield, preparation of land by plough team may
be the only effective way of sowing and weeding. For example, under the extensive
farming practices of central Mali, where the area per worker can be as high as 3-5 ha.,
plough teams play a major role in achieving high yields of millet per worker, as they
permit a very large area of land to be sown and weeded within a rainy season lasting
only 6 to 8 weeks (Toulmin, 1983). Farm households without their own plough team must
borrow equipment from others, often only available rather late in the season and they
suffer lower yields as a result, due to sowing much of their grain on unploughed land and
to the slowness of hand weeding.
48. In Ethiopia, land holdings are often smaller than in the Sahel, with each household farming on
average between 2.0 and 2.5 ha in the highland region.
49. While this would lead one to expect a greater potential role for hand preparation techniques, soils
are so heavy that hand preparation of land is actually extremely rare, being limited to the steepest
hillside plots. Given these soil conditions, farmers resorting to hand tools would probably face a
significant fall in the area they could cultivate.
50. Besides the fall in area cultivated when hand techniques are used, there are two additional costs
from the use of hand tools. First, soil preparation is likely to be less effective using hand tools, leading
to less successful seed germination, more competition from weeds and hence lower yields per
hectare. Second, the work involved in hand preparation is very considerable and would make
demands on household workers at a time when energy and food reserves were already very low.
(e) The provision of fertiliser by donors as a complement to hand tool distribution could
be considered. The increase in fertility would partially compensate for the fall in area
cultivated and the lower yields per hectare associated with use of hand tools.
Disadvantages to this option include the foreign exchange cost, if funded from
government resources, of fertiliser imports and the high costs of transport and
distribution to areas of need. To assess the likely effectiveness of this option one needs
to know the expected crop response from the application of a given quantity of fertiliser
per hectare. With fertiliser prices of around US$60 per 100 kgs, a price of US$300 - 400
per ton of grain and application rates of 100 kg/ha, crop output would have to rise by at
least 150 - 200 kgs/ha to make the scheme financially profitable. However, economic or
social profitability would demand a lower percentage increase in yields, taking account of
the cost of alternative food supplies for farming populations and the value placed on reestablishing viable farming communities.

(f) Supplementation of work oxen aims to improve draft performance by moderating
weight loss. The increase in draft power gained from supplementation depends on the
relative weight loss of supplemented and unsupplemented stock and on the demands
made upon draft animals, in terms of the length of a working day and the tractive power
required. Any improvement in performance is translated into higher crop production either
through an increase in area or through more timely sowing and weeding. The relative
size of each of these benefits is determined by the availability of land with which to
increase cultivated area and by the significance of timeliness for final yield. These factors
are likely to vary between different regions according to population densities and the
pattern and volume of rainfall. Within the Ethiopian context, for example, supplementation
of work oxen is likely to lead to improved tillage and more timely sowing of fields, rather
than a significant expansion in area cultivated, given the shortage of unoccupied arable
land in most farming regions. Benefits from supplementation will be greatest where it is
restricted to those animals which have lost a substantial amount of their body-weight and
whose subsequent ability to work is much impaired.

A comparison of alternative policy measures
The cost of doing nothin
51. The fourth column in Table 1 gives the estimated areas which could be cultivated for every
US$100 spent on each measure. Based on the data used for the table (summarised in the
notes below), there is remarkable similarity between the alternatives in terms of their cost.
Given the imprecision of these data, it would suggest that there is little to choose between the
options as far as their financial cost is concerned. Policy-makers should consider how the
relative cost of each option is likely to compare under the particular circumstances they face.
In order to do this, they need information on the following: (i) the prices and availability of
grain, oxen, fodder, tractors and fuel in the region concerned; (ii) the suitability of soils for
cultivation by tractor or some other machine; (iii) the shadow price of foreign exchange and
skilled labour to the economy; and (iv) the expected response of crop output to differing levels
of input use.

The cost of doing nothing
52. The cost of taking action to rehabilitate the farm sector after drought should be compared
with the cost of doing nothing, which includes the short-term cost of continuing to provide
famine relief to the affected population and the longer term consequence for the government
and national economy of low levels of agricultural production. The provision of food relief at a
basic 0.5 kgs of grain per adult per day implies a total of 900 to 1,000 kgs per annum for a
household containing 7 people, or 5 adult equivalents. The cost attributable to providing this
grain ration depends on the price of grain, the size of transport costs and on who pays the bill.
For example, grain provided free to a particular government for distribution as food aid will
cost the government little or nothing, depending on who is responsible for its transport and
distribution within the country. By contrast, grain which must be bought on the open market will
cost the government dear in foreign exchange and transport costs. Here, the price of grain is
assumed to be US$300-400 per ton, based on the cost of either buying local food grains or
buying grain on the world market plus transport costs to local markets, the latter probably
being as high as US$150-200 per ton for land locked states with poor road networks. Given
an average expected yield of 400 kgs per hectare following the interventions described above,
it can be seen that all of the policy options give a benefit cost ratio far in excess of unity in a
single year, even if no account is taken of the wider social benefits associated with reestablishing production in rural areas. There are consequently very strong arguments in favour
of pursuing the rehabilitation of farm production as an urgent priority.

Conclusions
53. This paper has discussed a range of policy measures aimed at rehabilitation of livestockrelated aspects of farm production after drought. It can be seen that there are a variety of
policies open to governments and agencies, each with particular cost and welfare implications.
Policies also differ in their spillover effects on the rest of the economy, some being precisely
targetted, such as a subsidy to a specific producer group, while others cause widespread
changes in the structure of prices and incentives within the economy. Choice between these
alternatives will be partially determined by the conditions faced in the post-drought period, in
terms of the resources domestically available - such as pastures, livestock, grain and seed local administrative capacity and the country's marketing and transport infrastructure. External
finance from aid agencies can help loosen some of these constraints by, for example,
supplementing local food supplies by relief grain.
54. It would be wise to consider as many policy options as possible, since conditions faced by
producers in different regions will vary greatly. For example, where local tractor power is
available, government credit or subsidies for tractor hire is an obvious option to pursue,
especially where local draft oxen supplies are limited and prices high. In areas where fodder
supplies are scarce and highly vulnerable to drought, alternatives to oxen as the main source
of draft should be considered. Similarly, while most oxen distribution schemes have involved
the provision of credit, the option of given stock should be considered under certain
circumstances, where repayment is subject to high risks and high costs of collection.
55. An assessment of policy options should include the consequences for the affected
community and national economy of taking no action. Governments can either continue to
provide food relief to drought-affected groups or leave them to help themselves. In either case,
there is a cost associated with taking no action, in terms of foregone output, the cost of
purchase, transport and distribution of food relief and the longer term social costs from the
dislocation of rural communities from self-sufficient production. The rehabilitation options
looked at in this paper compare very favourably with the cost of food relief provision and
should provide a fast return on invested resources. In this regard, returns are likely to be much
higher on projects of farm rehabilitation, involving the re-establishment of production using
traditional methods, than those aiming to introduce new crops and technologies to farmers.
Where the social cost to affected populations of foregone farm production is also taken into
account, the returns from funding rehabilitation, as opposed to relief measures, will be even
higher.
56. Policies for rehabilitation should be linked in future with more effective short-term relief
measures and long-term policies for establishing less drought-vulnerable systems. The
speedy provision of relief food supplies at an early stage of a drought, to farmers in greatest
distress, would reduce the subsequent need for more costly rehabilitation measures. For
example, if farmers in areas with sufficient pasture could get access to food relief, they would
be under less pressure to liquidate their livestock holdings. There would consequently be
more draft stock available and less need for oxen reconstitution programmes in the postdrought period. Rehabilitation policy should also be formulated in co-ordination with longer
term measures, since the post-drought period can offer a breathing space within which to
initiate changes in patterns of production and resource management. This will be particularly
important, for example, in areas where pre-drought levels of livestock had surpassed the
capacity of grazing normally available.

57. In the post-drought period, the shortage of livestock will constrain levels of production in
both the cropping and the pastoral sector. Given the importance of these two sectors for many
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, careful choices need to be made about the priority to be
given to helping one or the other sector. The high degree of interaction between the two
sectors, through animal and grain markets and competition for scarce fodder resources,
means that the effect on pastoral production from intervention in the farming sector should be
analysed and vice versa. For example, some competition will exist between the use of male
cattle for meat - by their fattening and early slaughter - and their being used for draft purposes.
The relative strength of demand for young oxen will depend on the incomes and purchasing
power of domestic and foreign consumers of meat and on the investment funds available to
farmers. Where drought losses of work oxen have been high, farmers' ability to reconstitute
their work oxen holdings will be reduced if they face strong competition for male animals from
meat markets. In such cases, some intervention may be necessary to achieve the desired
balance between satisfying immediate demands for meat and the requirements for
rehabilitating productive farm capital. The provision of credit to farmers to purchase work oxen
would have the dual effect of increasing farmers' purchasing power relative to meat
consumers while benefitting livestock-sellers by the upward effect on animal prices. In other
areas, the two sectors may be in competition for scarce resources as, for example, where a
limited supply of feedstuff or veterinary inputs is available for distribution.
58. A strong case can be made for priority to be given to crop production, given the
importance of grain in the diets of all consumers and of the poorest groups in particular. Reestablishing grain production will also benefit livestock producers by bringing down the relative
price of cereals to livestock. This will reduce both pressure on herders' incomes and the
number of animals needed for a viable livestock holding. However, some resources should
also be made directly available to the pastoral sector, given that extensive livestock production
is usually the only way to effectively utilise the sparse resources found in many semi-arid
regions. Grazing animals convert these resources into valuable products for the rest of the
economy as well as providing support to a given human population. The supply of young oxen
to the farm sector in future will also depend on the speed with which animal numbers and
levels of livestock productivity recover in the pastoral sector following drought.
