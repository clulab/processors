abstract
Close interactions of water-energy conditions at plant cover and interspace are so far largely overlooked in water-energy modeling for dryland ecosystems. This study focused on (i) introducing the plant-interspace heterogeneity into water-energy modeling for a dryland ecosystem, and (ii) investigating the inﬂuences of such heterogeneity on the ecosystem water-energy budgets. The plant-interspace heterogeneity was described using a two dimensional scheme. The soil-vegetation-atmosphere transportation processes were integrated with horizontal exchanges of water and energy. The model was parameterized and validated by ﬁeld observations (Yanchi, China). The modeled sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes were stronger at the shrub cover (SCA) compared to interspace, but soil surface was cooler. Moreover, the water-energy advections between the interspace and SCA showed mixed effects on the simulated water-energy budget of the ecosystem. The aboveground advections signiﬁcantly enhanced the evapotranspiration rate at SCA. The root uptake and horizontal inﬂows from the interspace amounted to over 40% of the annual water loss from SCA, resulting in a tight water budget at ecosystem level. These results emphasized the necessity of considering the plant-scale heterogeneities and horizontal processes in estimating waterenergy balances in such ecosystems. Our model can serve as a tool to simulate the water-energy dynamics in sparse-vegetated ecosystems regarding such interactions.

1. Introduction
Dryland (arid and semiarid) ecosystems cover over 40% of the land surface in the world, and the coverage is increasing due to climate change and anthropological disturbances such as deforestation and overgrazing (Asner et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2005). These ecosystems contribute to about 20% of the net primary productivity (NPP) of territorial ecosystems (Whittaker, 1975) and contribute signiﬁcantly to the variations of global carbon budget (Poulter et al., 2014). In dryland environments, the harsh water-energy conditions such as the low and irregular precipitation, prolonged dry periods and extreme temperatures, affect the dynamics and functioning of ecosystems and limit plant growth and ecosystem productivity (Noy-Meir, 1973).

Better understanding on the mechanisms of the water-energy balances of dryland ecosystems and their controlling factors are crucial for adaptive management under the projected climate change. This requires numerical models that can delineate the water-energy ﬂows and the feedbacks between the ﬂow processes and controlling factors. Over the past few decades, waterenergy models developed for dryland ecosystems generally employ soil-vegetation-atmosphere transportation schemes (SVAT) (e.g., Kremer and Running, 1996; Nouvellon et al., 2000; Xia and Shao, 2008). SVAT presume that the vertical water-energy gradients and the resistances from the rooting zone to boundary atmosphere dominate the ﬂow processes over the horizontal heterogeneities at the stand or footprint scale. Consequently, the ﬂow processes are usually simpliﬁed as one-dimensional. Such settings can be representative for ecosystems like boreal forests (e.g., Iritz et al., 1999), grasslands (e.g., Falge et al., 2005) and mires (e.g., Gong et al., 2013). However, for dryland ecosystems major gaps remain between the generality of current SVAT models and the reality of arid and semiarid environment.

Rango et al., 2006; see Fig. 1B). During nighttime, the surface soil tends to be recharged by multiple sources (Fig. 1B), e.g., by vapor condensation (Pan et al., 2010; Agam and Berliner, 2006), upward thermal/isothermal ﬂuxes (Milly, 1996) and root-mediated hydraulic lift (Horton and Hart, 1998; Caldwell and Richards, 1989). These ﬂows tend to differ between plant-covered and bare soils, due to the different proﬁles of temperature, root density and water storage. The heterogeneous water-thermal conditions, on the one hand, can drive micro-advections of heat and vapor over the different surfaces (Allen et al., 2011). On the other hand, horizontal exchanges of water, vapor and heat may occur between the soils under canopy and at interspace, as driven by the gradients of temperature and water potential. These diurnal dynamics are interacted with the seasonality of solar forcing, precipitation, plant phenology and physiology (Unland et al., 1996), leading to further complexity of the plant-soil interactions at the seasonal course.
Currently, the plant-interspace interactions have not yet been considered in available SVAT-based dryland models and the understanding on the effects of plant-interspace heterogeneities is still limited. In this work, we modeled the effects of plant-interface heterogenity on the water-energy balances in a semiarid desert shrubland ecosystem in northwestern China by employing a twodimensional scheme in process-based modeling. Model outputs (e.g., diurnal and seasonal dynamics of the surface energy balance, and soil temperature and water content) were evaluated against the ﬁeld measurements. The sensitivity of water-energy balances to the plant-interface heterogenity was also studied.

Dryland ecosystems are characterized by patchy vegetation and large fractions of bare soils (Domingo et al., 2000). In such environment, the water-energy processes can be highly heterogeneous and align to the distribution of plants (e.g., Rodríguez-Iturbe et al., 2001; Caylor et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2011). For example, foliage can enhance stem ﬂow but reduce soil compaction under canopy (Rango et al., 2006). Whereas at interspace, the soil surface could be less inﬁltratable (Belnap, 2006; Chen et al., 2013). As a result, runoffs are readily generated from the open area and run towards under canopy (Fig. 1A, Scheme I), a phenomenon referred to as “hydrological islands” (Rango et al., 2006). Yet, recent studies have suggested that the surface clogging by crusts in some ecosystems may limit runoff generation rather than promote it (Kidron et al., 2012). In this case, greater inﬁltration may occur at the interspaces, and drive the horizontal movement of water via subsurface ﬂows to soils under canopy (Fig. 1A, Scheme II).
The water movement between planted patches and interspace couple closely with the heterogeneity of surface energy balance. It is known that net radiation, surface temperature and evapotranspiration (ET) demand can vary signiﬁcantly from the plant-covered patches to the bare soils nearby (Flerchinger et al., 1998; Domingo et al., 2000). During daytime, the transpiration and shading tend to decrease the water storage faster but maintain a cooler temperature under canopy than interspace (Domingo et al., 1999;

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Outlines for the modeling
The modeled semiarid shrubland ecosystem located at the southern edge of the Mu Us desert (37◦42 31 N, 107◦13 47 E, 1560 m above sea level), Ningxia, northwestern China. The longterm mean temperature (1954–2004) is 8.1 ◦C and the frost-free season is 165 days on average (Wang et al., 2014). The mean annual precipitation is 287 mm, 62% of which falls from July to September (Jia et al., 2014). The radiation and evaporation demand are high in this area, i.e., the annual incoming shortwave radiation is 1.4 × 105 J cm−2 and the annual potential evaporation is 2024 mm on average. The ecosystem covers a ﬂat plateau of about 8 ha (Fig. 2A), and is dominated by scattered crowns of Artemisia ordosica (about 30% coverage, Fig. 2B). A layer of biological soil crust (mainly lichens, cyanobacteria and alges) covers about 90% of interspace soil. The thickness of the crust layer was 0.5 cm–2.5 cm.
Regarding the site conditions, the following assumptions were made to simplify the modeling work: (i) the landscape can be structured as the replication of similar land units, which consist of the area covered by shrubs and the surrounding bare soil (interspace); (ii) the water-energy exchanges and the ﬂow processes at the ecosystem level can be resembled by those of the land units with representative properties (e.g., crown sizes, LAI, root biomass, soil texture, etc.,); and (iii) each land unit can be considered as horizontally isotrophic, assuming that the spacing of shrubs is random, the crowns are centrosymmetric (see also net radiation citation) and the soil texture is horizontally homogeneous.
Following the above assumptions, the target ecosystem was outlined based on the setting of “representative land units” (RLU) with a cylinderical structure (Fig. 2C). Vertically, the RLU included the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) from the lower boundary of rooting zone to a reference height in the boundary atmosphere. Horizontally, the RLU comprised the SPAC volumes occupied by a shrub individual and the surrounding spaces, within which the soil hydrology was inﬂuenced mainly by the shrub at the center. Based

canopy (x = 1) and soil surfaces (x = 2, 3, . . ., n) were differentiated in modeling. These differences further drove the ﬂows of heat, water and vapor both vertially and horizontally, and were regulated by the diurnal dynamics of surface conditions (e.g., radiation, temperature and vapor pressure) and seasonal schemes of precipitation and leaf area.
Fig. 3 shows the conceptual framework for the key processes variables and included in the SVAT modeling. The exchanges of water and energy in ecosystem were simulated based on a combination of sub-models, which describe (i) the partitioning of radiative energy at canopy and soil; (ii) the exchange of energy between surface and boundary atmosphere; (iii) soil hydrology and the dynamics of soil water content; and (iv) heat transportation in soil proﬁle and the dynamics of soil temperature. The sub-models are linked by multiple feedbacks to represent the close coupling of water, vapor and energy transporations in the SVAT, which are critical to the arid and semiarid environments. The following sections detailed the algorithms employed by these submodels for the twodimensional modeling. The list of symbols is shown in Appendix A.

on the presumed centrosymmetric, the RLU can be partitioned into ﬁnite sectoral volumes of similar properties (e.g., sector ␣). Along the radial direction, a sectoral volume can be futher divided into multiple concentric fractions, e.g., the volume with shrub cover and those with bare surfaces. In this way, the water-energy processes at the RLU level was simpliﬁed into two-dimensional, and the horizontal heterogeneity of the ecosystem was represented by the gradient from the shrub-covered area (SCA) towards the interspace soils. Based on this scheme, the water-thermal conditions at

2.2.1. Partitioning of radiative energy and net radiation The partitioning of radiation at each surface fraction x (Fig. 2C)
was simulated based on a “radiative transfer model”, which coupled the controls of micro-structural (the structure of shrub individuals) and macro-structural (spatial distribution) properties (Bégué et al., 1994, 1996). At the micro-structure level, the transmittance of canopy depended on the foliage area (Lf ), the leaf angle distribution, the size of clump (i.e., height and diameter), the transmittance/reﬂectance of leaves and the zenith angle of incoming irradiance. At the macro-structural level, the shrubs were assumed to distribute randomly, and the probability of shrub numbers within a certain area was described using a Poisson function (Jia et al., unpublished). The transferring processes were parameterized separately for shortwave and longwave radiations. Details of the radiative transfer model are shown in Appendix B. For fractional surface x (x = 1 for canopy and x > 1 for soil surface, see Fig. 2C), the net radiation (Rnx) was the sum of the net shortwave and net longwave energy:

Rlx = Rsx + Rlx

(1)

where Rs and Rl denote the shortwave and longwave radiation. The short- and long-wave irradiances intercepted by canopy
(x = 1) and soil surfaces (x > 1) were:

Rsx =

Rsbx + Rsdx + Rsrxb + Rsrxd, x = 1 Rsbx + Rsdx , x > 1

(2)

Rlx =

Rldx + Rlrx, x = 1 Rldx , x > 1

(3)

where Rsbx , Rsdx and Rldx are the interceptions of the incoming beam, diffusive and longwave radiations; Rsrxb, Rsrxd and Rlrx are the interceptions of the reﬂected beam, diffusive and longwave radiations
(Eq. (B.22)). The incoming short- and long-wave radiations inter-
cepted by each surfaces fractions were:

Rsbx = Rssxb − Rsosxb

(4)

Rsdx = Rssxd − Rsosxd

(5)

Rldx = Rlsx − Rlosx

(6)

where Rssxb, Rssxd and Rlsx are the beam, diffusive and longwave irradiances reaching the surface x (Eqs. (B.12)–(B.15)); and Rsosxb, Rsosxd

and Rlosx are the outgoing beam, diffusive and longwave irradiances from the surfaces (Eqs. (B.16)–(B.21)).

2.2.2. Surface energy ﬂuxes Assuming the heat storage in the plant tissues aboveground is
negligible, the partitioning of net radiation was described respectively for canopy and soil surface fractions:

Rnx =

Hx + LEx, x = 1 Hx + LEx + Gx, x > 1

(7)

where H is the sensitive heat ﬂux; LE is the latent heat ﬂux; G is the ground heat ﬂux; superscript x denotes the xth surface fraction.
The latent and sensible energy ﬂuxes from the multiple sources were simulated employing an “interactive scheme” (Daamen and McNaughton, 2000), which was a more general form of the “multisource model” or “multi-layer model” (e.g., Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985; Choudhury and Monteith, 1988) with unrestricted number of sources. In this model, the turbulent diffusion theory (Ktheory) is taken as an adequate approximation for sparse canopies (Dolman and Wallace, 1991; McNaughton and van den Hurk, 1995). The latent and the sensible heat from each componental surface are mixed at a theoratical height (i.e., mean canopy source height zb). The latent heat ﬂux from surface fraction x was presented as follows (Daamen and McNaughton, 2000):

LEx =

/ b Axrh,x + bDb rv,x + / b rh,x

(8)

where b is the psychrometer constant ( b = acp/ b); b is the latent heat of vaporization at zb; acp is the volumetric speciﬁc heat

of air; is the slope of the saturated vapor presure curve against air
temperature; rh,x is the boundary-layer resistance for sensible heat; rv,x is the total resistance to water vapor ﬂow, the sum of boundary layer and surface resistances rv,x = rh,x + rc,x (rc,x is the surface resistance of canopy or soil); Db is the vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD) at zb; Ax is the availabe energy for evapotranspiration: A1 = Rn1 for canopy whereas Ax = Rnx − Gx for soil surfaces (x >1). The ground heat ﬂux (Gx) was calculated as following (Campbell, 1985):

Gx

=

KTx,1

Tx − Tsx,1 0.5Zsx,1

(9)

where KT is the thermal conductivity of soil; Zsx,1 is the depth of topmost soil, fraction x.
The calculation of b, b and Db (Eq. (8)) requires the vapor pressure (eb) and temperature (Tb) at zb. These variables were related to the total losses of latent heat (LEtot) and sensible heat (Htot) from all surfaces using the Penman-type equations:

LEtot = LEx = acp (eb − ea) /ra
b

(10)

Htot = Hx = acp (Tb − Ta) /ra

(11)

where Hx is the sensible heat ﬂux from surface x; ra is the aerodynamic resistance between the mean source height zb and the reference height za, and was a function of Tb accounting for the atmospheric stability (Choudhury and Monteith, 1988); Ta and ea are the air temperature and water vapor pressure at the reference
height.
The changes in energy balance affect surface temperature (Tx) and vapor pressure (ex), which further feedback to the energy availability (Eqs. (B.18) and (B.21)), the source-height temperature and

193

VPD (Eqs. (10)–(11)) and the resistance parameters (e.g., ra and rv,x). The values of Tx and ex can also be solved iteratively by coupling the energy balance equations (Eqs. (7)–(9)) with the Penman-type
equations as following:

LEx = wx acp (ex − eb) /rh,x
x

(12)

Hx = Ax − LEx = wx acp (Tx − Tb) /rh,x

(13)

where wx is the areal fraction of the surface x in RLU; x is the psychrometer constant. The boundary-layer resistance of canopy
(rh,1) and soil surfaces (rh,x, x > 1) were calculated following the approach of Choudhury and Monteith (1988).

2.2.3. Transportation of water and vapor in soil proﬁle The model coupled the vertical and the horizontal ﬂows of liquid
water, vapor and heat. For soil fraction x (x >1) and depth layer i (see Fig. 2C), the changes in moisture content was calculated as:

dÂx,i dt

=

dÂvx,i dt

+

dÂhx,i dt

+ Sx,i

(14)

where dÂv is the change in soil moisture content due to vertical ﬂuxes; dÂh is the soil moisture change due to horizontal ﬂuxes. S is a sink term, representing the water-content changes led by processes other than the pore-mediated ﬂows during dt (positive for gains and negative for losses):

Sx,i = Pxs + Exc,i + Exs,i + Exp,i + Exh,i /Zsx,i

(15)

where Ps is the through fall, and Pxs = 0 for i > 1; Ec is the transpirational water uptake by ﬁne roots; Eh is the hydraulic lift; Es is the soil evaporation (Es = 0 for i > 1); Ep is the evaporation or condensation of pore water (positive for condensation and negative for evaporation).
The canopy interception of precipitation was related of total foliage area (Lf ) following the approach of Iritz et al. (1999). The transpirative uptake of water (Ec) and the surface evaporation (Es) were related to the surface energy balance as follows:

Exc,i = LE1/ 1 frx,idt Exs,1 = LEx/ xdt

(16) (17)

where frx,i is the fraction of ﬁne roots in layer x, i (x > 1). The water redistribution via hydraulic lift was driven by the
differences in water potential among soil layers (Caldwell et al., 1998). Based on a simpliﬁed presentation of Ryel et al. (2002), the hydraulic lift to soil section x, layer i, from another layer (y, j) was described as:

Exh,i = CRT

j

y

hx,i − hy,j max Cx,i, Cy,j

frx,i fry,j 1 − fr

Dtran

(18)

where CRT is the maximal radial conductance of soil-root interface; Cx,i is a limiting factor based on hx,i (see details Sˇimùnek et al., 1996; Ryel et al., 2002); fr is the fraction of ﬁne roots in the source layer,
e.g., fr = frx,i if hx,i < hy,j; Dtran was assumed to be 1 during night whereas 0 during the day.
Following the Hydrus-1D model (see Sakai et al., 2009), either
the thermal or isothermal water ﬂux took into account the vapor
ﬂows together with the liquid ﬂows, because the vapor ﬂow is an
important ﬂux component in arid and semiarid soils (Milly, 1996). The total water ﬂux at the vertical direction (qvt ) was described:

qvt = qLvh + qvLT + qvVh + qvVT = KLh

∂h ∂Ts ∂h ∂z + 1 + KLT ∂z + KVh ∂z

+KVT

∂Ts ∂z

(19)

where the superscript v denotes the vertical direction; qLh and qLT
are the isothermal and thermal ﬂuxes of liquid water; qVh and qVT are the isothermal and thermal ﬂuxes of water vapor; KLh and KLT are the isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for liquid
water ﬂuxes; KVh and KVT are the isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for water and vapor ﬂuxes; h is the pressure head;
Ts is soil temperature; and z is the spatial coordinate at the vertical
direction (positive downward). Similarly, the total water ﬂux at the horizontal direction (qht )
was given as:

qht = qhLh + qhLT + qhVh + qhVT = KLh

∂h ∂y

+ KLT

∂Ts ∂y

+ KVh

∂h ∂y

+ KVT

∂Ts ∂y

(20)

where the superscript v denotes the horizontal direction; y is the
spatial coordinate at the horizontal direction (positive outward).
In soil volume (x, i), the changes in soil moisture content due to the vertical (dÂvx,i) and the horizontal ﬂuxes (dÂxh,i) can be expressed as the following discrete forms:

dÂvx,i

=

qvt,(x,i−1) + qvt,(x,i) Zsx,i

(21)

dÂxh,i =

Sxr−1,iqht,(x−1,i) + Sxr,iqht,(x,i) Vx,i

(22)

where qvt,(x,i)is the total vertical ﬂow (qvt ) from layer i to layer i + 1 (downward positive) at fraction x; qht,(x,i) is the horizontal ﬂow (qht ) from fraction x to fraction x + 1 (outward positive) at layer i; Vx,i is the total volume of layer i, fraction x; Sr x,i is the intersection area between soil volume (x, i) and volume (x−1, i), and

Sxr,i Vx,i

=

˛Lx Zsx,i

/ 0.5˛Zsx,i

Lx2 − Lx−12

= 2Lx/ Lx2 − Lx−12 (23)

where Lx is the distance from the canopy center to the boundary between fractions x-1 and x (see Fig. 2C). Details of the calculating
scheme for the hydraulic conductivities (i.e., KLh, KLT , KVh and KVT ) can be found in Saito et al. (2006) and Sakai et al. (2009).
The changes in vapor content in volume (x, i) were calculated
in a similar way compared to the liquid water, by replacing the water ﬂuxes (qht andqvt ) in Eq. (22) with the vapor ﬂuxes (qhVh + qhVT andqvVh + qvVT ). Condensation (or evaporation) occurred when the vapor density in the pore space was above (or below) the thresh-
old value:

Exp,i =

V x,i

−

Vs x,i

Hrx,i

Vx,i

(24)

where V is the mass density of vapor; Vs is the saturated vapor density and is a function of soil temperature (see Campbell, 1985); Hr is the relative humidity of air in pore space:

Hrx,i = exp

hx,i Mg R Tsx,i + 273.2

(25)

where M is the molecular weight of water; g is the gravitational acceleration; and R is the universal gas constant (see Philip and de Vries, 1957).
The water content in soil volume (x, i) was related to the pressure head using the method of van Genuchten (1980):

Âx,i = Ârx,i + Âsatx,i − Ârx,i

1 + −˛hhx,i n −m

(26)

where Âr is residual water content; Âsat is the saturated water content; ␣h, n and m are shape parameters and m = 1 − 1/n.

2.2.4. Heat transportation in soil proﬁle The soil heat ﬂux was calculated following the method of de

where z is the spatial coordinate at the vertical direction; y is the
spatial coordinate at the horizontal direction (positive outward);
Cw and Cv are the volumetric speciﬁc heat of water and vapor, respectively.
In soil volume (x, i), the changes in the heat storage (dSx,i) and soil temperature (dTsx,i) can be calculated as:

0 = x,i w, where is the latent heat of vaporization of liquid water and w is the density of liquid water; Ftv,(x,i)is the total vertical ﬂow (Ftv) from layer i to layer i + 1 (downward positive) at fraction x; Fth,(x,i) is the horizontal ﬂow (Fth) from fraction x to fraction x + 1 (outward positive) at layer i; Qx,i is a sink term for energy transportation associated with root-mediated water movement (Saito
et al., 2006) and freezing/melting.

2.3. Model parameterization and calibration

2.3.1. Meteorological and eddy-covariance measurements During year 2013, the incident photosynthetically active radi-
ation (PAR) was measured at our study site using a quantum sensor (PAR-LITE, Kipp and Zonen, the Netherlands). The incoming and outgoing irradiances were measured using a four-component radiometer (CNR-4, Kipp & Zonen, the Netherlands). The net radiation was calculated by subtracting the outgoing fractions from the total incoming energy. All the sensors were mounted on the tower at 4 m above the ground. Air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a thermo-hygrometer (HMP155A, Vaisala, Finland). Rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525WS, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., USA) mounted at a nearby site (2 km away, see Jia et al., 2014). Soil temperature and water content were monitored within 20 m from the tower (ECH2O-5TE sensors, Decagon Devices, USA) at depths of 10 cm (4 sensors), 30 cm (3 sensors) and 70 cm (3 sensors). Soil heat ﬂux was calculated as the sum of the heat ﬂux at 10-cm depth, measured at 10 m from the tower using ﬁve soil heat ﬂux transducers (HFP01, Hukseﬂux Thermal Sensors, Netherlands), and the rate of change in heat storage in the soil layer above the transducers (Jia et al., 2015). These sensors were installed at the interspace to avoid possible damages on the root system.
All micrometeorological variables were measured every 10 s and aggregated to 30-min resolution. The seasonal trends of the measured Ta, P and incoming radiations are shown in Fig. 4A and B. The annual rainfall of 2013 was 278.4 mm, 84% of which occurred

during June to September. July and September represented two wet months with 66% of the annual precipitation. There were four rain events larger than 15 mm day−1, which amounted for 46% (i.e., 129.3 mm) of the annual precipitation. No surface runoffs were observed throughout the year, indicating the horizontal redistribution of rainfall could be mainly through subsurface ﬂows at our site.
The eddy-covariance instruments were mounted at 4.2 m high (Fig. 2A), and oriented in the prevailing wind direction (northwest). Wind speed, direction and sonic temperature were measured by a 3-D ultrasonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., USA). A closed-path fast response infrared gas analyzer (LI-7200, LI-COR Inc., USA) was used to measure ﬂuctuations in CO2 and water vapor concentrations. More details about instrumentation and calibration, data processing, correction and quality controlling can be found in Jia et al. (2014). Footprint analysis using the ﬂux source area model (FASM) showed that >90% of the ﬂuxes originated from within 180 m of the tower. About 26% of the half-hour data was ﬁltered due to instrument malfunction, sensor calibration and data quality control. The measured LE accounted for a minor fraction of the available energy at either diurnal (13.1 ± 18.4%, mean ± SD) or annual scale (18.4%) (Fig. 4C). The overall performance of the eddy ﬂux measurement system was further evaluated by the degree of energy balance closure, which was 74% (Fig. 4D) if taking into account the heat stored in the soil above soil heat plates (see details Ochsner et al., 2007 and Jia et al., 2015).

2.3.2. Measurement of canopy sizes and the light interception by foliages
Two 30-meter transects were stretched from the eddycovariance tower to the south and north directions and 126 shrubs along these transects were measured. The diameter (d) of the shrubs was 83 ± 33 cm and the canopy height was 45 ± 13 cm (mean ± SD). Assuming the round shape of crown projection area (Li and Xiao, 2007), the estimated shrub coverage was 28%. Assuming that the ratio of shrub-covered area to interspace in an RLU was in line with that of the footprint area, the spacing parameter Ld can be solved from the following equation:

Ld + d/2

2
=

1 C

d/2 2

(30)

where C is the coverage of the shrub. The estimated Ld was 37 cm,
which was slightly lower than the halved distance between adja-
cent crowns (46 ± 27 cm, n = 137). Because the values of crown radius (d/2) and Ld were close, we set x = 3 in the model, meaning
that there was only one soil fraction for the interspace.
The seasonal changes in the total foliage area (Lf ) and the green leaf area (Ll) were measured based on a 100 m × 100 m area centered on the ﬂux tower using a hierarchical sampling method. The
measurement was carried out at roughly weekly intervals through-
out the growing season (see Jia et al., 2014 for details). The dynamics
of Lf and Ll were then obtained by ﬁtting the measured values against the day of year (DOY) when the measurements were imple-
mented (Fig. 5). For inter-growing season, we assumed Ll = 0 and constant Lf .
The light interception of canopy is usually described as a decay
function of Lf based on Beer’s law, assuming that the foliage is randomly orientated and distributed (e.g., Eq. (B.8), Appendix B).
However, the foliage of A. ordosica are sparse, with small leaves
and up-pointing branches. Therefore, the light interception of
A. ordosica could also depend on the zenith angle of incoming
radiation beside Lf . In this study, the relationship between the light-interception rate, Lf and the zenith angle were established. We selected 47 shrubs of various sizes, and measured the Lf value of each shrub using LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (LI-COR Inc.,
USA). When estimating Lf , LAI-2000 separated the all-sky area

(zenith angle from 0◦ to 90◦) into ring areas with different central zenith angles (␣z = 7◦, 23◦, 38◦, 53◦ and 68◦). For radiation from each ␣z, LAI-2000 recorded the rate of transmittance p(␣z) as a function of contact frequency K(␣z) and path length through the canopy S(␣z) as follows:

p (˛z) = exp [−K (˛z) S (˛z)]

(31)

where q(ɑz) = 1 − p(ɑz) is the interception rate of the incoming irra-
diance from ␣z. The Lf -p(␣z) relationship was regressed from the measured p(␣z) and Lf (Fig. 6A–D). For a given Lf , the values of p(␣z)

were then calculated based on the Lf -p(␣z) functions and were interpolated to obtain p(␣z) values for any ␣z [0◦, 90◦] (Fig. 6E).

2.3.3. Calculation of surface resistances The canopy resistance (rc,1) was calculated from leaf area (Ll)
and stomatal conductance (gs). The value of gs was determined by the maximal conductance (Xiao et al., 2005) multiplied by independent stress functions of PAR, canopy temperature, canopy VPD and moisture content in the root-zone soil (Stewart, 1988). The independent stress functions for PAR, temperature and VPD were shown by Chen et al. (1999). The stress function of soil moisture content was calculated following the measured trend of Gao et al. (2013). During a rain event, the amount of water intercepted by canopy was computed following the way of Iritz et al. (1999), and the value of rc,1 was set to 0 in case that the canopy was wet.
Soil surface resistance (rc,x, x > 1) was estimated using a widelyused function (see also Choudhury and Monteith, 1988):

rc,x = ␶ld,x/ (PsDvx)

(32)

where is a tortuosity factor; Ps is the porosity of soil; Dvx is the molecular diffusivity of vapor in air, and is a function of temperature
(Campbell, 1985); ld,x is the theoretical depth of dry soil layer at the surface, and increases proportionally with the decrease in the
moisture content of the topsoil (Choudhury and Monteith, 1988):

dld,x dt

=

dÂx,1 Âx,1

(33)

where Âx,1 is the moisture content in the topsoil (i = 1) of fraction x and dÂx,1 is the change in the soil moisture content; t is time.
This method implicitly assumes that the soil moisture content
is constant with depth. However, the effective vapor diffusivity

in the shallow sub-surface layer could be much greater than Dv (Choudhury and Monteith, 1988). Moreover, soil at surface tends to dry faster than at deeper positions, and drive the capillary ﬂows upward. As a result, the original function is likely to overestimate the soil resistance (Choudhury and Monteith, 1988). Experimental studies have shown nonlinear responses of soil resistance to the water-content changes in surface soils (e.g., 1–2 cm, see van de Griend and Owe, 1994; Kondo et al., 1990). Therefore, an adjustment factor x was introduced to ld,x for each surface fraction (x > 1):

l d,x = xld,x

(34)

where x was related to the moisture content in the top soil (x, 1) using an exponential function, which is similar to the resistance function established by van de Griend and Owe (1994):

x = exp a − Âx,1/ b where a and b are shape parameters (see Section 2.3.6).

(35)

2.3.4. Parameterization of root biomass and soil texture The vertical proﬁle of root biomass was parameterized following
Li and Xiao (2007). The root biomass was set to decrease with the distance from trunk (Zhang et al., 2008). The soil texture parameters were valued based on 12 soil cores collected randomly around the ﬂux tower (within 30 m). At each point, the soil was sampled at multiple depths (i.e., 10 cm, 30 cm and 60 cm), which covered the main rooting depth (i.e., 0–50 cm). Saturated water content (Âsat ), bulk density and residual water content were measured from each sample, and the values of each parameter were averaged by depths (Table 1).
The parameterization of soil hydraulic properties emphasized the different porosity and pore structures in crust and subsoil. The water retention parameters (␣h = 0.303, n = 1.416, Âr = 0.004) for crust were obtained from Shapotou site (see Wang et al., 2007), where the crust and vegetation were very similar. However, the subsoil at the Shapotou site was much coarser (sandy) than this one (ﬁne sandy loam). In this case, we employed n = 1.38 (Saito et al.,

(35)) to the variations of the parameter values of a and b (A), regressed slope coefﬁcient k (B) and RMSE (C) by comparing the measured LEtot to simulated values using different ( a, b) values, and regressed k and RMSE (D) by comparing the measured 10 cm temperatures to the simulated values under different kc values (Eq. (36)).

2006). The value of ␣h was then estimated by Eq. (26) if Â and the correspondent h were known. To carry out this estimation, the soil samples obtained from the three depths were saturated, and then covered and drained by gravity until the gravity ﬂow became negligible (i.e., 24–48 h). The remaining water content was regarded as ﬁeld capacity, which roughly represented the water content at a pressure head of 300 cm for ﬁne-texture soils (Wilson, 1980). The value of ␣h was then estimated from the measured ﬁeld capacity for each of the depths (Table 1). The methods used for estimating the hydraulic conductivities (i.e., KLh, KLT , KVh and KVT ) were detailed in Sakai et al. (2009) (see also in Saito et al., 2006).
The freezing point of soil water was set to 0 ◦C. The inﬂuences of soil freezing on the hydraulic conductivities were described following the way of Hansson et al. (2004). The thermal conductivity of unfrosted soil was calculated as a function of soil water content (Chung and Horton, 1987), and was assumed to increase linearly with the ice content:

KTx,i = kc fKT Âx,i + C1Âix,i

(36)

fKT Âx,i = b1 + b2Âx,i + b3Âx,i0.5

(37)

where b1, b2 and b3 are constants; fKT is the thermal conductivity function for unfrosted soil; CI is the thermal conductivity of ice; Âi is the ice content; kc is a correction term for the thermal conductivity of soil crust (i = 1), because the loose structure of the crust is likely
to reduce the thermal conductivity. kc = 1 was set for subsoil layers (i > 1).

2.3.5. Initial and boundary conditions Preliminary investigation on soil proﬁle showed that the root-
ing depth of A. ordosica at the site was generally within top 50 cm, and the soil type was homogeneous within the top 65–70 cm depth. Below 70 cm, limestone and clay layer appears. Therefore, we set the soil proﬁle to 67.5 cm in simulation, including the crusted topsoil (2.5 cm) and sandy subsoil (65 cm, stratiﬁed into 5 cm layers). Soil moisture content measured at 70 cm depth was used as the lower boundary condition for hydrological simulation. In arid ecosystems, the heat exchange at the lower boundary of rooting zone could be strong and the settings of the boundary conditions could be difﬁcult at this depth. Therefore, the calculation of soil temperature proﬁle was extended to 170 cm depth with no-ﬂow boundary at bottom, and the water content in soil layers below 70 cm employed the mean values measured at the 120 cm depth. Based on presumed similarity of RLU structures, no-ﬂux condition was assumed for the water and heat ﬂows at outer boundary.
The model was driven (time step = 30 min) by meteorological factors including the incoming shortwave radiation (Rsi), incoming longwave radiation (Rli), PAR, Ta, relative humidity (Rha), wind speed (u) and precipitation above canopy (P). The initial temperatures and soil moisture content for each soil layer were estimated by linearly interpolating the mean values measured at different depths, with absent horizontal heterogeneities. At each time step, surface energy ﬂuxes (i.e., Rnx, Hx, LEx and Gx), surface temperatures and vapor pressures were numerically solved by combining Eq. (1) and Eqs. (7)–(13). Vapor condensation occurred when the solved vapor pressure exceeded the saturation point. Absorption of atmospheric water vapor was also considered when the surface

Rh exceeded that of the pore air. The two-dimensional transpiration of water and energy in the soil proﬁle was solved numerically using Predict–Evaluate–Correct–Evaluate (PECE) method. In order to avoid undesired numerical oscillations, the soil simulation was further downscaled into sub steps. At each sub step, the solutions were stabilized by adjusting the time length, so that the temperature changes were within a maximum difference of 0.2 ◦C.
2.3.6. Model calibration The unknown shape parameters a and b for calculating soil
resistance was obtained by calibrating the simulated LEtot (Eq. (10)) against the half-hour values measured by the eddy-covariance system. The calibration was based on a 48-h period following a rain event on DOY 136, which was the ﬁrst rain event (6.5 mm) after melting with observable inﬁltration ﬂux at 10 cm depth. The green leaf-area index was small (<0.05), therefore the disturbance from transpiration simulations could be ignorable. Fig. 7A shows that by varying a and b, Eq. (35) was able to cover a wide range of –Â relationships. In the calibration, the values of a and b were changed from 0.05 to 0.30 at a resolution of 0.01, respectively. The kc value was set to 0.5 for crust layer for the calibration of the resistance parameters, because initial calculations showed

that changing the kc value by ±50% yielded very limited inﬂuences (i.e.,<1%) on the simulated LEtot . The simulated LEtot was regressed linearly against measured values (Y = kX, where X and Y are the predictor and evaluator). The responses of k and root mean square error (RMSE) to the variations of a and b values are shown in Fig. 7B and C. The values of ( a, b) were set to 0.27 and 0.13 based on the following criterions: i) the slope coefﬁcient k (0.99, 1.01), and ii) the RMSE was minimized (RMSE = 18.5 W m−2). Based on the optimized a and b, we further ran the model by varying the kc value from 0.1 to 1.0 at a resolution of 0.1. For each kc, the half-hourly temperature at the 10 cm depth was simulated for the calibration period (i.e., DOY 137–138) and was ﬁtted against the measured values (Fig. 7D). The slope of regression approached unity around kc = 0.3, and the RMSE (0.94 ◦C) was the simulated minimum. Therefore, kc = 0.3 was set in the model. The values of other parameters are shown in Table 2.
2.4. Model validation and sensitivity analyses
2.4.1. Model validation The model capability to describe the radiation partitioning (sub-
model (i), see Fig. 2) was investigated by comparing the simulated

J. Gong et al. / Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 221 (2016) 189–206

199

half-hourly values of net radiation (Rntot = Rnx, Eq. (1)). As the energy transferring processes were differentiated for shortwave and longwave radiations, we further compared the in modeled outgoing shortwave radiation (Rsout , Eq. (B.23)) and outgoing longwave radiation (Rlout , Eq. (B.24)) against those measured in 2013. The simulated surface energy ﬂuxes, i.e., latent heat ﬂux and sensible heat ﬂuxes were compared to the half-hourly values measured by the eddy-covariance system, in order to validate the modeling of surface energy ﬂuxes (submodel (ii)). For the validation of soil hydrology and temperature simulations (submodel (iii–iv)), the modeled half-hourly values of soil moisture content and temperature (interspace) were also compared against those measured at 10 cm and 30 cm depths. Linear regression was used for the comparison of modeled and measured values.
2.4.2. Sensitivity analysis We tested the sensitivity of the model to the changes in a num-
ber of parameters (Table 3). Model Runs 1–8 were done to reveal the model uncertainties as related to the hydraulic parameters, which were very roughly estimated (i.e., ␣h) or adopted from remote sites (i.e., n, Ksat and CRT ). In Run 3 and 4, the original n = 1.38 was adjusted to represent the changes in soil textures from coarse (sand, n = 2.09) to ﬁne (silt clay, n = 1.19) (Campbell and Shiozawa, 1992). In Runs 9–14, we further investigated the model sensitivity to the variability of RLU structures (i.e., d and Ld, see Fig. 2C) and the saturated water content of soil (Âsat ). This is because these parameters may vary largely among the land units over the footprint area, and the ecosystem responses to these variations could be highly nonlinear. In Runs 11–14, the probability distribution of d and the shrub density at ecosystem level were not manipulated. In Runs 11–12, the changes in d also inﬂuenced the foliage area and green leaf area (Li and Xiao, 2007). For each test, the ecosystem-level energy ﬂuxes (i.e., Rntot , LEtot and Htot ), and the soil moisture content and soil temperature at 10 cm and 30 cm depths were simulated, and the percentage of changes in these variables were calculated by comparing the simulated values to those simulated without the parameter adjustment.
We computed the annual horizontal exchanges of water and heat between the soils under canopy and that at the interspaces, and compared the contribution of the horizontal ﬂuxes to the total water-energy budgets. To investigate the effects of horizontal exchanges on the water-energy balances, we cut off the water-energy interactions between the canopy-covered area and the surrounding interspaces (Runs 15–16). The model responses to the cutting off of horizontal exchanges belowground (Run 15) and aboveground (Run 16) were calculated, respectively, for the SCA, the interspace and the RLU as a whole. In Run 16, the aboveground advections were eliminated by replacing the interactive resistance scheme with the patch scheme, which assumed zero exchanges of vapor and heat between the different surfaces (see details in Norman et al., 1995 and Daamen and McNaughton, 2000).
3. Results
3.1. Model validity
The simulated outgoing radiations correlated strongly with the measured values (Fig. 8A and B). The model explained 97% and 96% of the variations in the measured outgoing shortwave radiations and outgoing longwave radiations, respectively. The RMSE were 11.7 (shortwave) and 63.5 W m−2 (longwave), which were one order-of-magnitude lower than the seasonal variations of these radiation components. The linear regressions showed that the model underestimated the outgoing shortwave and longwave radiations. Such underestimations were 12% and 1.6% annually

for shortwave and longwave components, respectively. The model explained 99% of the variations in the measured half-hour values of Rntot . Comparing to the seasonal variation of Rntot , the linear regression model showed that the biases between the modeled and measured values were marginal (Fig. 8C). The RMSE of the simulated Rntot was 46.4 W m−2.
The model explained 80% of the variations in the measured Htot and 73% of the variations in the measured LEtot (Fig. 8D and E). The simulated Htot showed greater scattering from observation at higher Htot values. Also, the model was found biased in capturing a number of LEtot points. Nevertheless, the systematic deviations of the modeled values were marginal. The RMSE of the simulated Htot and LEtot were 48.0 and 20.3 W m−2, which were approximately one order-of-magnitude of the seasonal variations of Htot and LEtot . By combining the simulated Htot and LEtot , the model explained 85% of the variations in the measured values of the total turbulent energy (i.e., Htot + LEtot ). There were no signiﬁcant systematic deviation between the measured and the modeled values (Fig. 8F).
Large variations in the measured soil temperatures were found at both diurnal and seasonal scales (Fig. 9A and B). The modeled soil temperatures for the interspaces followed well the trend of the measured values, although the model tended to slightly underestimate the soil temperature in April (i.e., after melting) but overestimate it in November and December. The model explained 98% of the variations in the temperature measured at 10 cm and 30 cm depths. The modeled soil temperatures were generally higher in the soils at interspaces than that under the canopy. Such difference was greater at the 10 cm depth (i.e., 1.4 ± 0.9 ◦C, mean ± SD) than at the 30 cm depth (i.e., 0.6 ± 0.4 ◦C). About 95% of the differences were smaller than 3.0 ◦C at 10 cm depth and 1.2 ◦C at 30 cm depth.
The measured soil water content peaked in July and September (Fig. 9C and D), following the frequent rain events. During other ice-free months (i.e., soil temperature above 0 ◦C), the soil water content was generally above 0.1 cm3 cm−3 at 10 cm depth and above 0.15 cm3 cm−3 at 30 cm depth. Considerable variations were found among the readings of 10 cm sensors, whereas such variations were less pronounced at 30 cm deep. The modeled results mainly underestimated the soil water content during the frosted season. Moreover, the simulated melting in spring and the soil freezing in winter was later than the measurement showed. For the ice-free period, the model simulation was generally within the range of mean ± SD of the measured data, although the simulated water content was more sensitive to rain events than the observed one. The model explained 76 and 70% of the variations in the mean values of the water contents measured at 10 cm and 30 cm depths, respectively.
3.2. Model sensitivity
Adjustment of the soil hydraulic parameters (Table 3, i.e., ␣h, n, Ksat , CRT and Âsat ) produced small changes in the simulated values of Rntot , Htot and soil temperatures. Moreover, the simulated energy ﬂuxes, soil temperatures and water contents were insensitive to the changes in Ksat and CRT . However, changes of the water retention parameters (i.e., ␣h and n) and Âsat signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the simulated LEtot and soil water content, although the changes in the annual mean water content were less obvious. Increasing d or decreasing Ld increased the SCA fraction. This change decreased the Bowen ratio (Htot /LEtot ) and soil temperatures, but enhanced the ET rate. The simulated energy ﬂuxes and soil temperatures showed greater sensitivity to the changes in Ld than d. In particular, reducing the spacing parameter Ld by 50% increased the simulated LEtot at the ecosystem level by 75%.
During year 2013, the SCA contributed 32% of Htot at the ecosystem level (Table 4). The ﬂux densities of sensible heat and net

radiation were greater by 19 and 15% at the SCA than at the
interspace. SCA contributed 41% to LEtot . The annual ET at SCA (402 mm year−1 shrub-covered area−1) was 79% greater than that at the interspace (i.e., 224 mm year−1 interspace area−1), although
the soil evaporation at SCA was lower (Fig. 10A). The drainage loss
occurred mainly at the interspace. At the ecosystem level, the ET
accounted for 98% of the annual rainfall, whereas the water loss
from the root-zone bottom (the sum of vapor and water ﬂuxes) was
much more limited (Fig. 10A). The water extracted from interspaces to SCA was 32.7 mm year−1 on the RLU basis, in which the transpirational uptake by root systems was near 20 mm year−1. On the other
hand, the amount of water and vapor transported from the interspaces to under-canopy soils (rooting-zone) was 12.8 mm year−1 on the RLU basis. This equals to a water input of 45.7 mm year−1 to
the SCA, considering the shrub coverage was 28%. The interception

loss by canopy accounted for 18% on the SCA basis and 5.2% on the RLU basis.
The simulated ET from the different surfaces decreased when cutting off the aboveground/belowground exchanges on the horizontal direction (Runs 15–16, Table 4). This manipulation also reduced the net radiation, due to the increases in surface temperatures and outgoing longwave radiation. When eliminating the horizontal exchanges of water and vapor (Run 15), the simulated ET, especially the transpirational water loss, was reduced by more than 30% (Fig. 10B). Although the change in soil water storage was slight, the total discharge increased by 73% on the RLU basis. Such change was mainly contributed by the increase of discharge from the interspaces. Whereas the discharge at the lower boundary of SCA turned to a net recharge of 14 mm year−1. By cutting off the heat advections between the SCA and interspaces (i.e., Run 16), the

soil evaporation under canopy dropped by 80% (Fig. 10C). Associated with the decrease in ET, the SCA soil became wetter and discharges increased signiﬁcantly at both the SCA and interspace. The net water inﬂux from the interspaces to SCA changed to a net outﬂow of 1.9 mm year−1 from the SCA on the RLU basis.
4. Discussion
4.1. Evaluation of model performance and uncertainties
The model validation showed that the simulated surface radiation followed well the measurement at the ecosystem level (year 2013). No signiﬁcant systematic deviations were either found in the simulated LEtot and Htot . At belowground, the simulated soil temperature and water content agreed well with the measured means during the ice-free period, although the soil temperature

was overestimated slightly towards the end of the year. The model may captured the key processes and the representative site conditions, which dominated the water-energy exchange in the studied ecosystem. In this sense, the model could be used as a quantitative tool for water-energy simulation in the semi-arid shrub ecosystems similar to the Yanchi research site.
The uncertainties of modeling, however, may exist in the following aspects. The simulated turbulent energy ﬂuxes were found to scatter from the measured values. This may result from two reasons. Firstly, in dryland ecosystems, the latent heat ﬂux usually constitutes a minor energy loss during prolonged dry seasons (Fig. 4C). As a result, small biases in the simulated thermal advections and Rn could yield a relatively large impact on the estimated LEtot . While Rn and surface resistances mainly represent the diurnal and seasonal cycles (Li et al., 2007; Krishnan et al., 2012), the sensible heat ﬂux, however, is closely linked to the wind velocity and stability of boundary air (Jacobson, 2005), which can be highly dynamic at ﬁne timescales. Therefore, it could require to model the dynamics of these factors at a higher frequency than to simulate the radiation and surface resistances.
Secondly, the lack of energy balance closure of the eddy covariance measurement increased the difﬁculty of modeling, i.e., about 26% of the measured Rntot was missed or not included in the surface partitioning of energy (Fig. 4D). Independently measured ﬂux components for the energy balance hardly reach closure, and this deﬁciency of eddy covariance method has been well documented (Sun et al., 2008; Franssen et al., 2010; Larsen et al., 2016). An important reason for the imbalance could be that the footprints of radiation and ground heat ﬂux measurements often mismatch with that of the eddy-covariance system, which tend to vary with the changes in wind direction, surface properties and turbulent strength (Jacobson, 2005; Larsen et al., 2016). For our case, sensitivity analysis showed that LEtot was strongly inﬂuenced by the

vegetation condition (e.g., crown dimensions, see Table 3) and soil hydraulic features (e.g., n and Âsat ), which tended to vary considerably within a relatively short distance. The measured turbulent ﬂuxes thus could deviate signiﬁcantly from the “mean” conditions, particularly when the footprint area was small and less representative. In addition, the energy closure could also be affected by the site topography, for example masses may travel along the slope and “leak” from the SVAT system. To reduce the uncertainty caused by the energy imbalance, Larson et al. (2016) suggested that it would be helpful to correct the radiation measurement based on the turbulent conditions. For this purpose, the radiation measurement should be linked to the temporal changes of the footprint area and the spatial patterns of plant distribution and soil properties.
The lack of energy balance closure further indicated that the modeled ground heat ﬂux could have been overestimated, due to the possible underestimation in the turbulent ﬂuxes. This could have led to the overestimation of the modeled soil temperature in the second half of the growing season. Moreover, the impacts of solvents on the thermal conductivity and freezing/thawing (e.g., Viterbo et al., 1999) were not included. This could have led to the biases in the temperature and water content simulations during the freezing period. However, the simulated soil water content agreed reasonably well with the measured means during the icefree season. The results of parameter sensitivities suggested that the variations in the soil-texture parameters (e.g., Âsat and n, see Table 3) strongly inﬂuenced the simulated soil water content. This indicated that the variability of the soil texture among the land units could also contribute a major uncertainty to the modeling. In this sense, further developments in the numerical method and associated measurements for including the spatial variation of soil texture are still needed to improve the generality of the model.

The number inside bracket represents the annual ﬂux (A) or its change (B and C) on the basis of corresponding surface type (SCA or interspace).

4.2. Effects of the plant-interspace interactions on the ecosystem water-energy exchanges
Our simulations showed that the presence of shrub cover largely inﬂuenced the water-energy balances. Compared to interspace, shrubs enhanced transpiration and rainfall interception. This led to a much greater ET from SCA than that at the interspaces, and reduced the discharge loss from the root-zone bottom (Fig. 10A). Moreover, the foliage facilitated the emission of sensible heat (Table 4). Such canopy effects (i.e., transpiration and reducing net radiation) helped SCA to maintain a relatively cool and wet condition (Fig. 11), which are helpful for xeric shrubs to adapt to the heat and radiation stresses (Nilsen and Orcutt, 1998; Flerchinger et al., 1998). These results further implied that, the thermal-moisture conditions in the vegetated and non-vegetated areas are likely to respond differently to disturbances such as climate warming and

J. Gong et al. / Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 221 (2016) 189–206

203

extreme climatic events (e.g., droughts). Because temperatures and moisture content are vital regulators of many ecophysiological processes of plant and crust biomes (e.g., Wang et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2014), the plant-scale heterogeneities thus shall be addressed in future studies on the climatic sensitivity of carbon exchanges in these ecosystems.
Our modeling emphasized also the inneligible role of waterenergy exchanges between SCA and the bare soils nearby. Ignoring such exchanges (i.e., Run 15–16) signiﬁcantly increased the biases in the simulated energy ﬂuxes (Table 4). In arid and semiarid ecosystems, hydrological interactions between plant and interspace are critical to the dynamics of vegetation pattern and the functioning of “resource islands” (Reynolds et al., 1999; von Hardenberg et al., 2001; Rietkerk et al., 2002, 2004). Previous studies have mainly attributed such interactions to the heterogeneity of inﬁltration, which is related to the different rates of rain interception, runoff production and inﬁltration at the plant-covered and interspace soils (Rango et al., 2006; Caldwell et al., 2008). In this study, the simulated water ﬂux derived from the interspace to shrub cover amounted to over 40% of the annual rainfall on the SCA basis (including both transpirational uptake and soil ﬂows). However, no surface runoffs were observed from our site and the canopy interception accounted only for a minor loss of precipitation (Fig. 9A). Therefore, the modeled horizontal ﬂux can be hardly explained by the heterogeneity of inﬁltration, but the competition of shrubs and interspace over water resources for ET. For example, the modeled water uptake by root system contributed to over 60% of the modeled water delivery from the interspace; the horizontal water movement during non-rainy days contributed to about 20% of the total water delivery. Although more detailed research are still needed for better understanding the spatiotemporal variability of such ﬂows, our results indicated that the demand-driven delivery could serve an important mechanism in regulating the pattern of soil moisture, other than the heterogeneity of inﬁltration.
The demand-driven delivery highlights the close connection between the soil hydrology and energy balance, as ET represents the major loss of input water. This was supported by the results of sensitivity analysis, that the advections of heat and vapor between the canopy and interspace signiﬁcantly enhanced the ET at SCA and the hydrological interactions (see Run 16). The advections aboveground and hydrological delivery at subsurface could function counteractively in regulating the vegetation pattern in such ecosystems. This means, the pattern needs to be sparse enough to satisfy the water extraction of shrubs, whereas the interspace area needs to be small enough to limit the heat advection and evaporation. With respect to the current shrub pattern, the water demand at SCA and the excessive water at interspace were well bridged by the hydrological delivery, so that a delicate balance between water availability and water use was reached at the ecosystem level. Over 95% of annual precipitation was consumed by ET, whereas only a limited fraction of water was drained from the rooting zone. The tight water budget agreed with the long-term observations for other A. ordosica communities in this area (see Li et al., 2013). A key adaption of vegetation in water-restricted environment is that the extraction of soil water tends to be maximized whereas the water losses tends to be minimized (Rodríguez-Iturbe et al., 2001; Seyfried et al., 2005; Scanlon et al., 2005). From the perspective of water use, the vegetation growth may approach the upper limit under current P-ET regime. Further increase in the shrub coverage would probably enlarge the water demand to a point that the precipitation cannot meet. Moreover, a high sensitivity of the ecosystem to changes in precipitation regime or extreme climate events (e.g., droughts) is likely, because the decrease in shrub coverage may stress the rest shrubs by enhancing the thermal advections and deteriorate the growth further.

Future studies on the ecohydrology of such ecosystems should investigate the plant cover and interspace soil in an integrated way. Compared to many semiarid ecosystems (e.g., Jia et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2011), the water storage in the root-zone soil was much higher (e.g., >0.1 cm3 cm−3) at our site, probably due to the ﬁne texture and consequentially high water retention capacity of the soil. This could provide critical buffering for the climatic disturbances. For example, the water storage in the root-zone soil decreased by about 12 mm during 2013, and such a change was close to the precipitation difference (about 10 mm lower) of year 2013 to that of the long-term mean. In addition, the lateral water ﬂows between RLUs were considered as negligible in our study, although the topography could strongly impact the pattern of soil water on hillslopes (e.g., Chen et al., 2013). Therefore, the variations in soil texture and lateral hydrology should be considered in modeling of plant-interspace interactions at sites of different topography or at hillslope and catchment scales.
5. Conclusions
We modeled the effects of plant-interface heterogenity on the water-energy balances in a semiarid desert shrubland ecosystem in northwestern China by employing a two-dimensional scheme in process-based modeling and integrating the soil-vegetationatmosphere transportation processes with horizontal exchanges of water and energy. The model well captured the measured trends of energy ﬂuxes, soil temperature and soil water contents based on half-hourly time steps. Our model simulations showed much greater ET but lower surface temperatures at SCA than for the interspace. The aboveground advection of heat and vapor tended to enhance the water loss at SCA. However, the water demand in the shrub-covered soil was strongly supported by the belowground ﬂows from the interspace. When integrating the vertical exchanges with the horizontal advections, the ET consumed over 95% of annual precipitation in the studied ecosystem. This tight water budget indicated a likely high sensitivity of the ecosystem to the potential changes in precipitation and extreme climate events (e.g., droughts). Based on our modeling work, the effects of plant-interface heterogenity should be considered in a modeling of water-energy balances a semiarid desert ecosystems. Our model offered a useful mean to study the water-energy dynamics in sparse-vegetated ecosystems as controlled by plant-interface heterogenity.

B.1 Canopy interception of incoming irradiance

In the “radiative transfer model” (Bégué et al., 1994, 1996), the shrub canopies are described as porous cylinders (Bégué, 1992; see also Fig. 2C), which consist of elements (e.g., wooden branches and leaves) of different transmittances. Assuming the branches are opaque and the mixture of leaves and wood is homogeneous, the directional transmittance (p(ɑz) [0,1]) of a clump can be calculated as following (Bégué, 1992):

p (˛z) = exp −Kc (˛z) × Lf 1 − f + Lw

(B.1)

where ɑz is the zenith angle of incoming beam; Lf is the leaf area index of the clump; Lw is the surface area index of wooden branchess; f is the transmittance of leaves; Kc(ɑz) is the light extinction coefﬁcient.
At the macro-structure level, the canopy interception is fur-
ther affected by the mutual shading between shrub (Bégué et al., 1994). The canopy interception of direct-beam radiation (Rs1b) can be calculated following Bégué et al. (1994):

ε (˛z) = [P1 (˛z) q (˛z)] + [P2 (˛z) p (˛z) q (˛z)] +. . . + Pn (˛z) p(˛z)n−1q (˛z)

(B.2)

andRsb1 = Rsbi (1 − ac) ε (˛z)

(B.3)

where ε (˛z) is the interception rate of direct beam at the macrostructure level; q(ɑz) is the interception rate of the beam at micro-structure level and q(ɑz) = 1 − p(ɑz); Pn (n = 1, 2, . . .) is the

probability of the beam being intercepted by n shrub clumps; Rsbi is the incoming direct beam; ac is the albedo of shrub canopy. Based on the presumed randomness of shrub distribution over the land-
scape, the distribution of the shrub number within a ﬁxed area
can be described as a Poisson function, and the probability Pn of n interception can be calculated using a Boolean model (Bégué et al.,
1994):

Pn (˛z) =

ıA¯ (˛z) n!

n
exp

−ıA¯ (˛z)

(B.4)

where ␦ is the density of the shrubs; A¯ (˛z) is the average area of an clump projected to the ground at zenith angle ɑz, and is a function of ɑz and the probability distributions of D and H (Bégué et al., 1994):

∞∞
A¯ (˛z) =
00

4 D2 + dH · tan (˛z) fpD (D) fpH (H) dDdH

(B.5)

where fpH (D) and fpH (H) are probability density functions of D and H, respectively.
The canopy interception of diffusive radiation (Rs1d) was calculated by integrating the beam interception function for solar zenith
angles across all-sky area:

22

εd =

ε (˛z) d˛zdˇ

(B.6)

00

andRsd1 = Rsdi (1 − ac) εd

(B.7)

where εd is the interception rate of diffusive radiation at the macrostructure level; Rsdi is the incoming diffusive radiation.
Assuming the pathway of longwave radiation was similar to that
of the diffusive radiation, the canopy interception of the incoming
longwave radiation thus was:

Rld1 = Rli (1 − alc) εd

(B.8)

where Rli is the incoming longwave radiation; alc is the canopy albedo for the longwave radiation, and alc = 1 − εc, where εc is the longwave emissivity of canopy.

B.2 Partitioning of incoming irradiances at soil surface

Based on Eqs. (B.1)–(B.8), the total beam (Rssb), diffusive shortwave radiation (Rssd) and longwave radiation (Rls) reaching soil surface were:

Rssb = Rsbi [1 − ε (˛z)] (1 − ac)

(B.9)

Rssd = Rsdi (1 − εd) (1 − ac)

(B.10)

Rls = Rli (1 − εd) (1 − alc)

(B.11)

At the RLU scale, the incoming radiances (Rssb, Rssd and Rls,) at the xth fraction of soil surface was calculated as the area-weighted sum
of the irradiance received by the sunlit and shaded soils:

Rx = wsxhadeRshade + 1 − wsxhade Rsunlit

(B.12)

where Rx is the substitution of the direct beam (Rsxsb), diffusive (Rsxsd) or longwave irradiances (Rlxs ) received by surface fraction x;Rshade and Rsunlit is the correspondent irradiance at the shaded and the sunlit surface, respectively; wsxhade is the percentage of the area being shaded by the canopy in the xth surface fraction, and is a function of the canopy dimensions (i.e., height and diameter), zenith angle of the incoming irraidance and the position of the xth surface fraction (e.g., 100% shadowing for soil under canopy but partly for that at interspaces).

J. Gong et al. / Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 221 (2016) 189–206

205

The incoming irradiances at the sunlit and shaded surfaces (Rsunlit and Rshade) of an RLU was further subjected to the environmental light conditions at the macro-structural level. By introducing a “prob” RLU randomly into the landscape for enormous times, Rsunlit and Rshade can be described as following:

Rsunlit = SradR

(B.13)

Rshade = SradR (1 − ε)

(B.14)

where R is the substitution of Rssb (Eq. (B.9)), Rssd (Eq. (B.10)) or Rls (Eq. (B.11)) for direct beam, diffusive radiation and longwave
radiation, respectively; is the interception rate of irradiance, and

ε = ε (˛z) for beam whereas ε = εd for diffusive or longwave radiation; Srad is an adjustment factor, because that introducing the “prob” RLU into the landscape increased the total canopy intercep-

tion but reduced the irradiance received by the soil surface. As the

total irradiance transported to soil surface in an RLU shall resemble

that at the ecosystem scale, the value of Srad is thus calculated as:

Srad = R/

n wx Rx
2

(B.15)

where the values of Srad and Rx can be solved iteratively by combining Eqs. (B.12)–(B.14) for direct beam, diffusive radiation and
longwave radiation.

B.3 Calculation of outgoing irradiances

Based on Eqs. (B.1)–(B.8), the outgoing irradiances from canopy (x = 1) can be calculated as:

Rsos1b = Rsbiacε (˛z) Rsos1d = Rsbiac εd Rlos1 = Rlialc εd + εc T14

(B.16) (B.17) (B.18)

The outgoing irradiance of direct beam, diffusive and longwave radiation from soil fraction x (x > 1) were:

Rsosxb = Rsxsbasx Rsosxd = Rsxsdasx Rlosx = Rlxs alx + εx Tx4

(B.19) (B.20) (B.21)

where T the surface temperature, ε the emissivity of longwave radiation (εx = 1 − alx), and ␴ the Stefan Boltzmann’s constant.asx and alx are the albedos of shortwave and longwave irradiances, and are
functions (see Saito et al., 2006) of the moisture content in the
topmost soil (Âx,1, Eq. (26)). We assumed that the light path was reversible for an incom-
ing irradiance and its reﬂection, and the secondary reﬂection and
scattering of the reﬂected light were insigniﬁcant. Therefore, the
canopy interceptions of the outgoing irradiances from all soil sur-
face fractions were given as following:

Rr =

n
(wxRO) ε
2

(B.22)

where Rr is the substitution of Rs1rb, Rs1rd (Eq. (2)) and Rl1r (Eq. (3)) for the canopy interception of the reﬂected direct-beam, diffusive and longwave irradiances, respectively; RO is the substitution of Rsosxb (Eq. (B.12)), Rsosxd (Eq. (B.13)) and Rlosx (Eq. (B.14)) for correspondent radiation type; wx is the fractional area of surface x.
Combining Eqs. (B.12)–(B.18), the total outgoing irradiances for
shortwave (Rsout ) and longwave (Rlout) can be calculated as:

Rsout =

n
1 wxRsosxb +

n
1 wxRsosxd − Rs1rb − Rs1rd

(B.23)

Rlout =
