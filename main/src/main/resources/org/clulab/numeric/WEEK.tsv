#
# list of weeks and their date ranges, case insensitive so everything is lower case for simplicity
# the comments after // are required by WeekNormalizer to get the week date ranges! Do not remove.
# The format for the date ranges must be MM-dd:MM-dd or MM:MM.
# Note: multi-word phrases must be tokenized in the same way as our tokenizer. If not sure, try the
# phrases in ./shell first!
#
# Update: If the week (left column) includes a pipe (|), the "week" will be split into multiple
# entries all having the same date range to the right.  Weeks will also be trimmed so that the
# entries can be vertically aligned to assure that nothing has been forgotten.  Empty values between
# || will also be removed.
