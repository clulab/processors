# list of seasons and their date ranges, case insensitive so everything is lower case for simplicity
# the comments after // are required by SeasonNormalizer to get the season date ranges! Do not remove
# the format for the date ranges must be MM-dd:MM-dd or MM:MM
# note: multi-word phrases must be tokenized in the same way as our tokenizer. If not sure, try the phrases in ./shell first!
