A mixed trend of maize and sorghum retail prices were observed in monitored markets. 
In SNNPR, maize prices showed an increasing trend as more people depend on the market in the lean season. For example, maize prices increased by 12 % in Awassa, by 20% in Dalocha, 19 % in Enseno and 6% in Wolayta Sodo markets compared to previous month prices (see Figure 3). Wheat prices in Tigray increased by 8 to 14% in Mehoni, Adigrat, Adwa and Sheraro markets. Other monitored markets showed stable retail prices. 

Shoat to cereal: despite improvements in livestock body conditions and market opportunities (EID Araafa), increased prices of white maize in Jijiga depressed the terms of trade , whereby TOT declined by 18% against last month. On the other hand, shoat to white maize terms of trade in Afar region (Yalo and Awash Fentale) and South East Oromia (Yabelo and Negelle) remained stable against the preceding month. The terms of trade between shoat and white maize ranges from 85kg to 118kg in Oromia; 123- 125 Kg in Jijiga and Afar monitored markets. 
Wage to cereal: Unskilled daily wage to cereal terms of trade remained stable in most monitored markets in Amhara and Tigray regions. The TOT ranges between 6.35kg to 10.26kg for barley in Tigray and 4.36Kg to 8.93 kg for sorghum in Amhara. The terms of trade with white maize ranges from 8.33kg to 14.18 kg in Tigray and 9kg to 15.63 kg in Amhara region markets.
