Agojo settlement continues. A consultation was held with the host community of Agojo on the possibility of drilling a production well to extend water to Agojo settlement to serve both refugees and the host community. 

Health: The capacity of the host community medical services, including the blood bank, the Gambella Hospital and services at the Akobo entry point, remains limited. 
Education: There are insufficient numbers of teachers and limited teaching materials available. In the newly established Ngunyyiel camp, there is no secondary school. 

Protection: In Juba, over 100 IDP new arrivals are living in community shelters and have yet to be registered for any assistance. Lack of registration and food assistance remains a major concern for new arrivals, and many arrived to the PoC site without any personal belongings. 
Food security and nutrition: A recent UNHCR assessment in Gorom settlement, Central Equatoria, concluded that the recent lack of rain has severely affected the second season crop harvest. The second season harvest is a key source for supplementing food requirements that cannot be met by WFP food distribution. To improve this, UNHCR and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will train refugee farmers on early warning systems. 

Protection: In Arua, the capacity of the police force needs to be strengthened to ensure continued protection of the refugees and host community. Foster families require greater support and foster care arrangements need to be strengthen. In Rhino, there is the need for increased psychosocial support and counselling. In Palorinya, the registration and relocation exercise needs to be expedited. 
Education: Educational structures need to be in place prior to the next academic year. 
WASH: There is an ongoing need to ensure a sustainable and predictable supply of water to the settlements.
