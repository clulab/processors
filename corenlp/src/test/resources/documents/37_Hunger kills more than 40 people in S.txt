Hunger kills more than 40 people in S. Sudan’s Amadi state
July 11, 2017 (YAMBIO) – More than 40 people have died as a result of hunger in Mvolo county of South Amadi State, authorities disclosed
Tuesday.
The state coordinator for Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, Wilson Moga attributed it to
influx over 25,000 displaced persons into Mvolo county.
“In Mvolo, we have a serious hunger as a result of the dry spell and due to influx of IDPs
[Internally Displaced Person] from some payams who were displaced due to conflict between
cattle keepers and farmers in Mvolo county and because of the crisis in the country we have
people who came from Yambio, Maridi, Mundri and other places who fled due to conflict in those
area," Moga told Sudan Tribune.
“Since 2015, we have a serious drought in Mvolo which resulted into poor harvest and people
could not plant well as it used to be in the previous years. As per now people are surviving on
wild fruits and very few people have vegetables that they are feeding on, but this is not enough
for the entire population," he added.
In response to the crisis, Moga said, the Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB) and the United
Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) are assisting primary health care centers handling children

suffering from malnutrition and other diseases within the county.
The official appealed to other partners to visit Mvolo and assess the conditions being faced by women and children in the county and offer the
necessary assistance.
An estimated 1.1 million children in the country are acutely malnourished, according to UNICEF. In addition, children lack clean water, which has led
to the ongoing outbreak of cholera – the longest and most widespread in the country’s history – with 10,000 cases reported, the majority children.
The civil war in South Sudan has raged on for the past three years with such viciousness that parts of the country are bereft of food and a third of the
population fled their homes.
