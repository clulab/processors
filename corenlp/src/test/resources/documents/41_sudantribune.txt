U.N agency says South Sudan conflict fueling famine
May 30, 2017 (JUBA) – The ongoing conflict in South Sudan is likely to undermine efforts to prevent the outbreak of another famine next year, the
head of the U.N Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), said.
Jose Graziano da Silva said ethnic violence involving forces loyal to President Salva Kiir against
those loyal to the country’s former First Vice­President, Riek Machar remains a threat to the
agency’s work.
"If they don’t stop the war, what we are doing will be in vain," he said, lamenting the destruction
of crops and attacks on the FAO premises and warehouses,” Da Silva told the Associated Press.
"We cannot continue that way. We are wasting money and time if we don’t stop the war,” he
added.
He said FAO was trying to provide food, seeds and livestock simultaneously to farmers to take
advantage of the rainy season.
An estimated 100,000 people face starvation in South Sudan, where crop production has
plummeted since 2013 as the conflict has killed tens of thousands and forced 3.5 million people

Nearly two million have fled South Sudan due to its ongoing conflict, the worst­ever since it gained independence from neighbouring Sudan in July
2011.
