Hunger forces 45,000 people out of Unity state homes
August 9, 2015 (MAYOM) – Severe hunger has forced nearly 45,000 people out of their homes in Mayom county of South Sudan’s Unity state,
eyewitnesses and local authorities told Sudan Tribune on Sunday.
The ex­Mayom county commissioner, Charles Machieng Kuol said majority of those
affected fled to Warrap, Central Equatoria state and neighbouring Sudan due to lack of
food.
“The ongoing crisis in the country has left the area inaccessible by traders from Sudan.
Before the conflict, Mayom county used to receive goods from Sudan through South
Kordofan state,” said Kuol.
“Trade worsened during the conflict as there was no exchange of goods from Sudan
and the other states of South Sudan,” he added.
For instance, the price of 50 kilograms of sorghum has now reached to 850 SSP, a
price considered too high for ordinary persons to afford.
“Local citizens, who have no jobs, cannot afford the current cost of sorghum. As a result
of this hunger, many people have abandoned their homes to neighboring states looking
for food,” said Kuol.

“Most areas in the county are left without health facilities and this poses huge challenge
to common citizens,” he further stressed.
Kuol appealed to international humanitarian organisations to quickly respond to the needs of the population who are facing severe hunger.
“Since last year up to now, the area is under an immense attack from. We call upon humanitarian organisations to assess the needs of people in the
area,” said the former Mayom county commissioner.
The Mayom county paramount chief, Madut Gatluak told Sudan Tribune that the population in at least seven of the 11 payams have been badly
affected by hunger.
“Most people are deserting their homes and fleeing to Bhar el Ghazal in search of food,” Gatluak said over phone on Sunday.
The paramount chief attributed the food crisis to long periods of drought in the county.
“This year has witnessed serious drought. The few people who have tried to cultivate have not succeeded due of low rainfall,” he said.
Over the years, Mayom county has emerged as the food basket for the oil­rich Unity state, but low levels of rainfall have badly disrupted this year’s
normal farming activities.
