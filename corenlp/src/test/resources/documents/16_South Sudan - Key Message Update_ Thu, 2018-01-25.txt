Key Message Update

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) persist
as the lean season starts early
January 2018
Key Messages:
Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes persist in all regions of South Sudan in January. It is
expected most households who harvested have depleted their stocks this month, three months earlier than was typical
in pre-crisis years. As a result, the 2018 lean season has started earlier than normal and food security is expected to
further deteriorate through the peak of the lean season in July/August. Given expected very low food access during
this time, there remains a risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) in a worst-case scenario of an extended absence of
assistance. Urgent action is needed to end the ongoing conﬂict and allow for unhindered delivery of humanitarian
assistance.
There remains high concern for households in Greater Baggari, though it is expected many households in this area
had access to some harvests and food security has marginally improved. However, it is expected some households in
this area lack access to sufﬁcient food and could be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5)*. Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) also
remains likely in parts of Nyirol, Leer, and Ayod, where some households did not harvest and ongoing insecurity is
limiting access to assistance and movement towards natural food sources.
Despite the Cessation of Hostilities (COH) agreement signed in late December, armed clashes between Government
forces and armed opposition continue in Unity, Central Equatoria, and parts of Western Equatoria. Additionally, tension
remains high in parts of Jonglei, Lakes, and Warrap, where inter-communal clashes have occurred, and in central and
southern Unity, due to the resurgence of various armed groups and an uptick in cattle raiding. Despite ongoing conﬂict
in many areas, 250 IDPs from Bor PoC voluntarily returned to Fangak, and humanitarian partners supported the
relocation of the remaining 562 IDPs in Melut PoC prior to the closure of the camp.
Data collection for the Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System (FSNMS) has been completed in most counties
of South Sudan. These data, collected in December and January, provide information on likely food security and
nutrition outcomes during the post-harvest period. The South Sudan Technical Working Group will meet in late
January/early February and utilize these data, and other recent assessments, to conduct an IPC analysis. This
analysis will analyse current food security outcomes and project food security outcomes through July 2018.
*According to the IPC, a Famine (IPC Phase 5) has occurred when at least 20 percent of households in a given
area have an extreme lack of food, the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) prevalence, as measured by weight-forheight z-score (WHZ), exceeds 30 percent, and mortality, as measured by the Crude Death Rate (CDR), is greater
than 2 per 10,000 per day. Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) is when a household group has an extreme lack of food
and/or other basic needs even with full employment of coping strategies.
