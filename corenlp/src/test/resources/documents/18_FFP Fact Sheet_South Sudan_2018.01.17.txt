SOUTH SUDAN
Updated January 17, 2018


After nearly four years of civil conflict, South Sudan remains one of the most
food-insecure countries in the world. By the end of the 2017 lean season in
September—the period of the year when food is most scarce—
approximately 56 percent of the country’s population was facing lifethreatening hunger and in need of humanitarian assistance, making 2017 the
most food-insecure year in South Sudan’s history.



Despite slight improvements in food availability due to seasonal harvests
from October to December, the 2018 lean seasons began in January—three
months earlier than usual—according to the Integrated Food Security Phase
Classification (IPC). Food security is expected to deteriorate through
March, with an estimated 5.1 million people—nearly half of the population—
facing Crisis (IPC 3) or worse levels of acute food insecurity.*



In particular, ongoing conflict has severely affected areas of Western Bahr El
Ghazal State, resulting in approximately 20,000 people experiencing
Humanitarian Catastrophe levels of acute food insecurity—or famine at the
household level—meaning that starvation, destitution and death are evident



As of January 2017, approximately 2.4 million refugees have fled South Sudan for neighboring countries and another 1.9 million
South Sudanese remain internally displaced. Widespread insecurity continues to displace communities, disrupt livelihood
activities, exacerbate food insecurity and impede humanitarian access to vulnerable populations.
*The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a standardized tool that aims to classify the severity and magnitude of food insecurity. The IPC scale, which
is comparable across countries, ranges from Minimal—IPC 1—to Famine—IPC 5.



A sustained and unimpeded humanitarian response is critical to saving lives and preventing a deterioration to Famine (IPC 5)
levels of acute food insecurity. Since the start of the conflict, the USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and its partners—
including the UN World Food Program (WFP) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF)—have responded to the needs of
South Sudan’s most vulnerable and conflict-affected populations through emergency food and nutrition interventions. In FY
2017, FFP-supported programs provided life-saving food assistance to 1.1 million people per month, on average.



FFP also partners with Catholic Relief Services to provide families in Jonglei State with emergency food assistance, expand
access to safe drinking water, and implement livelihoods interventions, including providing agricultural training for farming
households.
