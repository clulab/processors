Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist said he was looking forward to his summer
break after a Nacho Novo wonder strike won the Scottish Cup as the Gers secured
a domestic double.
The Ibrox side's narrow 1-0 victory over a battling Falkirk side means Rangers
can add the Scottish Cup to the Scottish Premier League championship they won on
the final day of the season.
It brings to a close a long season for the Ibrox side which begun with a
Champions League qualifier against FBK Kaunas on July 30 last year.
The Glasgow giants, who the season before had reached the UEFA Cup final,
suffered a painful elimination from Europe at the hands of the Lithuanian
minnows.
And while McCoist says the club will look to buy more players in the summer, the
fact they put the disappointment of the Kaunas defeat behind them to secure a
league and cup double was testament to the effort the players had put in since
he and Walter Smith returned to the club in January 2007.
"It can always get better in terms of the team and the squad. With a bit of luck
we can maybe add to that and look to strengthen," McCoist said.
"But in terms of what the boys achieved in the last two years the team deserve
all the credit going.
"Last year was so close to being the best season in the club's history. It ended
up being, in many people's eyes, a disappointment when we lost the league on the
final day.
"We can sit and talk about it all day if we deserved or we didn't deserve it.
The fact is we didn't win it.
"I just felt that this year it was a real reward for the players."
McCoist added: "I am absolutely looking forward to my break like you have no
idea. I've got the golf clubs looked out and hopefully I'll take a few quid off
the manager in the summer.
"I think the players will be looking forward to getting away from us more but
they really need a break, especially with last season when they didn't get as
much of a break as we would've liked."
McCoist also heaped praise on striker Novo, who scored 36 seconds after coming
off the bench at half-time.
The Spaniard collected a Sasa Papac throw-in to send a sensational strike past
Falkirk keeper Dani Mello from 30 yards out as the Ibrox side lifted the
Scottish Cup for the 33rd time.
And McCoist, himself a legendary striker with the Gers, said it was a goal
worthy of winning any cup final.
"It was very good. Looking at the context of the game and the quality of the
goal it will take some beating," McCoist said. "It's certainly one of the great
goals to win any cup final in any country I would think.
"I can still see it. I was actually praying he would hit it as he got himself
that wee half yard in front and I thought, just have a hit and see what happens,
and I knew it would be close.
"Nacho is just an incredible wee guy. He's got a wonderful rapport with the fans
and the rest of the squad.
"He deserves his success because he works so hard every day in training.
"Anywhere lights up when the wee fellow walks in, whether it's onto a football
park or into a room, heâ€˜s just that kind of person.
"If anyone deserves the success it's him as it's not easy when you're on the
bench."
And after securing his fourth double while in charge of the Glasgow giants
manager Walter Smith said he would be in charge next season to collect more
trophies, despite speculation to the contrary.
"Certainly in Glasgow you are surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of rumours.
You obviously just have to wait and see what happens," Smith said.
"Going upstairs today (to collect the Scottish Cup) is the kind of thing I
wanted to do when I came back to Rangers.
"They are the kind of stairs I want to walk up. That's why I came back."
Chilean health authorities confirmed 26 new cases of swine flu on Sunday,
raising the number of patients with A(H1N1) virus in the country to 276, the
highest number on the continent.
The sometimes-deadly disease continued its rise across Latin America meanwhile
with Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and the Dominican Republic all reporting
new cases.
Officials here said that most of the victims were in the capital, and that most
cases were mild and being treated at home. Three people remain in serious
condition in hospital, however.
Swine flu has killed nearly a hundred and infected over 15,500 worldwide,
according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, since it emerged in North
America in late April.
According to figures released by individual governments, the virus has actually
now killed more than 110 people around the world.
In the southern hemisphere, health experts fear the new virus could take hold,
as winter sets in and the regular flu season gets underway.
Argentine health authorities meanwhile reported 15 new cases on Sunday, a day
after reporting 20 new cases, raising the country's total patient count to 115.
Officials in Buenos Aires said those with new swine flu infections were
recovering well and that most of them were found at several private schools in
the capital, where students had recently returned from the United States.
The outbreak has prompted officials to close the schools for two weeks in a bid
to contain the virus.
In the Dominican Republic officials confirmed nine cases of the disease, raising
the country's total to 11, a day after Santo Domingo rebuffed a Russian claim
that the Caribbean island was underreporting its cases in a bid to boost
tourism.
"We fear that in reality, the situation is very different," Gennady Onishchenko,
Russia's chief sanitary inspector, had told the Interfax news agency in response
to the island reporting only two cases.
On Sunday the island's Ministry of Public Health reported that of the nine new
cases one had been hospitalized.
In Peru health authorities said they had confirmed two more cases of the virus,
bringing the country's total to 40.
Both cases were found in Lima and are recovering well on medication at home,
officials said.
Brazil also confirmed four new cases, which brought the country's total number
to 20.
At its last count at the end of last week Mexican authorities said 97 people had
died from the disease and that 4,932 had been infected. Officials however
maintained that the epidemic was on the wane there.
The row over MPs' expenses is distracting Britain's politicians from confronting
the serious economic issues facing the country, a prominent business leader said
Monday.
Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, told the Financial Times that all
the main parties should be focusing on their plans to deal with the recession
ahead of European and local elections later this week.
"I've just been talking to business people in Brussels and the sense of
bewilderment about what's happening and what it means for the UK and Europe is
palpable," Lambert told the FT.
"We've got important elections and they are being completely overshadowed by
these disclosures."
He added: "Clearly there's an enormous, understandable public outrage... but
we've got big decisions to be taken by all the big political parties about the
future shape and role of the state, and these have been completely brushed to
one side."
Polls over the weekend suggested British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour
party is in danger of coming third in the elections for the European Parliament
on Thursday, largely because of disillusionment over the expenses row.
The main opposition Conservatives have also suffered from the scandal and
analysts expect fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party (Ukip)
and the far-right British National Party to benefit.
Brown insisted Sunday that he was focused on the recession, brushing aside calls
for him to quit in favour of a more popular leader and saying: "I am dealing
with the economy every day."
In an article in the Daily Mirror, he also launched a strong attack on the BNP,
describing them as a "nasty extreme party" made up of "Nazi thugs" and urging
voters not to back them when they go to the polls this week.
