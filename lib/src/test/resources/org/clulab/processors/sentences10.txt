Needed lines of action will be decided on by representatives of some 50 nations .
Scarcity , not only of foodstuffs but of lumber and other forest products , textiles , seeds , fertilizers , draught power , and farm equipment will continue throughout most of Europe and Asia during the coming year .
Hopes of continued recovery in Europe 's indigenous food supplies were checked by last winter 's bad weather .
Diets in Western and Central Europe will be still lower next year , and in Asia they will remain at present very low levels , unless imports can be increased .
Even to hold the present line will require drastic action .
Minimum import needs for Europe , North Africa , and Asia in 1947/48 may be estimated at 34 to 38 million tons without allowing for any improvement in bread rations , any additional livestock feeding , or any increase in working reserves .
Against this need , supplies of grain available for export from the surplus countries may be tentatively estimated at 30 to 34 million tons .
Even with somewhat larger supplies of certain other foods particularly potatoes , sugar , and fats the situation will continue to be grim .
Cessation of UNRRA activities and accumulated foreign exchange difficulties worsen the problem for nations in a weak bargaining position .
Every delay in improving this situation further impairs the working ability of labour , slows up reconstruction , adds to the physical damage caused by prolonged undernourishment , and accelerates social unrest .
