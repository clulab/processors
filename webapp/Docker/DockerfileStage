# This file is similar to the plain Dockerfile, but that is for running
# Eidos in development mode and this is for Prod(uction) mode.  The main
# difference is in how Eidos is started up, which here is in a way that
# minimizes the time between when the last RUN command completes and when
# the first query can complete.
