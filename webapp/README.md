# webapp

This subproject of Eidos houses code that implements a web page that displays
output from Eidos in HTML format.  There are diagrams, text, and tables.
The main [../README.md#webapp](../README.md#webapp) file explains more.

## Execution

One can start the webapp directly from within `sbt` in development mode with the command `webapp/run`.  The web page will then be accessible at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

## Dockerization

The subdirectory `Docker` contains `Dockerfiles` to generate images in
multiple varieties along with documentation in the [Docker/README.md](./Docker/README.md) file.

In recent versions of Eidos there is also a `docker.sbt` file which allows one
to build an image from within `sbt`.  This method tends to be much faster than
the alternatives.  A command alias `dockerizeWebapp` has been set up to first cache
geonames (in ./cache/geonames) and then construct the image including the names.
If the cache has already been constructed, one can use the command
`webapp/docker:publishLocal` to just build the image.

To run the resulting image, use a command like
```bash
docker run -d --env secret=<secret> -p 9000:9000 --restart unless-stopped eidos-webapp:latest &
```
The secret is the value for `play.http.secret.key` used in
[conf/application.conf](./conf/application.conf) to protect the application.
